<H1><A NAME="Introduction to OpenLDAP Directory Services">1. Introduction to OpenLDAP Directory Services</A></H1>
<P>This document describes how to build, configure, and operate OpenLDAP software to provide directory services.  This includes details on how to configure and run the stand-alone <TERM>LDAP</TERM> daemon, <EM>slapd</EM>(8) and the stand-alone LDAP update replication daemon, <EM>slurpd</EM>(8). It is intended for newcomers and experienced administrators alike.  This section provides a basic introduction to directory services and, in particular, the directory services provided by <EM>slapd</EM>(8).</P>
<H2><A NAME="What is a directory service">1.1. What is a directory service?</A></H2>
<P>A directory is a specialized database optimized for reading, browsing and searching.  Directories tend to contain descriptive, attribute-based information and support sophisticated filtering capabilities. Directories generally do not support complicated transaction or roll-back schemes found in database management systems designed for handling high-volume complex updates.  Directory updates are typically simple all-or-nothing changes, if they are allowed at all.  Directories are tuned to give quick response to high-volume lookup or search operations. They may have the ability to replicate information widely in order to increase availability and reliability, while reducing response time.  When directory information is replicated, temporary inconsistencies between the replicas may be okay, as long as they get in sync eventually.</P>
<P>There are many different ways to provide a directory service. Different methods allow different kinds of information to be stored in the directory, place different requirements on how that information can be referenced, queried and updated, how it is protected from unauthorized access, etc.  Some directory services are <EM>local</EM>, providing service to a restricted context (e.g., the finger service on a single machine). Other services are global, providing service to a much broader context (e.g., the entire Internet).  Global services are usually <EM>distributed</EM>, meaning that the data they contain is spread across many machines, all of which cooperate to provide the directory service. Typically a global service defines a uniform <EM>namespace</EM> which gives the same view of the data no matter where you are in relation to the data itself.  The Internet <TERM>Domain Name System</TERM> (DNS) is an example of a globally distributed directory service.</P>
<H2><A NAME="What is LDAP">1.2. What is LDAP?</A></H2>
<P><TERM>LDAP</TERM> stands for <TERM>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol</TERM>.  As the name suggests, it is a lightweight protocol for accessing directory services, specifically <TERM>X.500</TERM>-based directory services.  LDAP runs over <TERM>TCP</TERM>/<TERM>IP</TERM> or other connection oriented transfer services.  The nitty-gritty details of LDAP are defined in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2251.txt">RFC2251</A> &quot;The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3)&quot; and other documents comprising the technical specification <REF>RFC3377</REF>.  This section gives an overview of LDAP from a user's perspective.</P>
<P><EM>What kind of information can be stored in the directory?</EM> The LDAP information model is based on <EM>entries</EM>. An entry is a collection of attributes that has a globally-unique <TERM>Distinguished Name</TERM> (DN).  The DN is used to refer to the entry unambiguously. Each of the entry's attributes has a <EM>type</EM> and one or more <EM>values</EM>. The types are typically mnemonic strings, like &quot;<TT>cn</TT>&quot; for common name, or &quot;<TT>mail</TT>&quot; for email address. The syntax of values depend on the attribute type.  For example, a <TT>cn</TT> attribute might contain the value <TT>Babs Jensen</TT>.  A <TT>mail</TT> attribute might contain the value &quot;<TT>babs@example.com</TT>&quot;. A <TT>jpegPhoto</TT> attribute would contain a photograph in the JPEG (binary) format.</P>
<P><EM>How is the information arranged?</EM> In LDAP, directory entries are arranged in a hierarchical tree-like structure.  Traditionally, this structure reflected the geographic and/or organizational boundaries.  Entries representing countries appear at the top of the tree. Below them are entries representing states and national organizations. Below them might be entries representing organizational units, people, printers, documents, or just about anything else you can think of.  Figure 1.1 shows an example LDAP directory tree using traditional naming.</P>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="intro_tree.gif" ALIGN="center"></CENTER></P>
<P ALIGN="Center">Figure 1.1: LDAP directory tree (traditional naming)</P>
<P>The tree may also be arranged based upon Internet domain names. This naming approach is becoming increasing popular as it allows for directory services to be located using the <EM>DNS</EM>. Figure 1.2 shows an example LDAP directory tree using domain-based naming.</P>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="intro_dctree.gif" ALIGN="center"></CENTER></P>
<P ALIGN="Center">Figure 1.2: LDAP directory tree (Internet naming)</P>
<P>In addition, LDAP allows you to control which attributes are required and allowed in an entry through the use of a special attribute called <TT>objectClass</TT>.  The values of the <TT>objectClass</TT> attribute determine the <EM>schema</EM> rules the entry must obey.</P>
<P><EM>How is the information referenced?</EM> An entry is referenced by its distinguished name, which is constructed by taking the name of the entry itself (called the <TERM>Relative Distinguished Name</TERM> or RDN) and concatenating the names of its ancestor entries. For example, the entry for Barbara Jensen in the Internet naming example above has an RDN of <TT>uid=babs</TT> and a DN of <TT>uid=babs,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com</TT>. The full DN format is described in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2253.txt">RFC2253</A>, &quot;Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3):  UTF-8 String Representation of Distinguished Names.&quot;</P>
<P><EM>How is the information accessed?</EM> LDAP defines operations for interrogating and updating the directory.  Operations are provided for adding and deleting an entry from the directory, changing an existing entry, and changing the name of an entry. Most of the time, though, LDAP is used to search for information in the directory. The LDAP search operation allows some portion of the directory to be searched for entries that match some criteria specified by a search filter. Information can be requested from each entry that matches the criteria.</P>
<P>For example, you might want to search the entire directory subtree at and below <TT>dc=example,dc=com</TT> for people with the name <TT>Barbara Jensen</TT>, retrieving the email address of each entry found. LDAP lets you do this easily.  Or you might want to search the entries directly below the <TT>st=California,c=US</TT> entry for organizations with the string <TT>Acme</TT> in their name, and that have a fax number. LDAP lets you do this too. The next section describes in more detail what you can do with LDAP and how it might be useful to you.</P>
<P><EM>How is the information protected from unauthorized access?</EM> Some directory services provide no protection, allowing anyone to see the information. LDAP provides a mechanism for a client to authenticate, or prove its identity to a directory server, paving the way for rich access control to protect the information the server contains.  LDAP also supports privacy and integrity security services.</P>
<H2><A NAME="How does LDAP work">1.3. How does LDAP work?</A></H2>
<P>LDAP directory service is based on a <EM>client-server</EM> model. One or more LDAP servers contain the data making up the directory information tree (DIT).  The client connects to servers and asks it a question.  The server responds with an answer and/or with a pointer to where the client can get additional information (typically, another LDAP server).  No matter which LDAP server a client connects to, it sees the same view of the directory; a name presented to one LDAP server references the same entry it would at another LDAP server. This is an important feature of a global directory service, like LDAP.</P>
<H2><A NAME="What about X.500">1.4. What about X.500?</A></H2>
<P>Technically, <TERM>LDAP</TERM> is a directory access protocol to an <TERM>X.500</TERM> directory service, the <TERM>OSI</TERM> directory service. Initially, LDAP clients accessed gateways to the X.500 directory service. This gateway ran LDAP between the client and gateway and X.500's <TERM>Directory Access Protocol</TERM> (<TERM>DAP</TERM>) between the gateway and the X.500 server.  DAP is a heavyweight protocol that operates over a full OSI protocol stack and requires a significant amount of computing resources.  LDAP is designed to operate over <TERM>TCP</TERM>/<TERM>IP</TERM> and provides most of the functionality of DAP at a much lower cost.</P>
<P>While LDAP is still used to access X.500 directory service via gateways, LDAP is now more commonly directly implemented in X.500 servers.</P>
<P>The stand-alone LDAP daemon, or <EM>slapd</EM>(8), can be viewed as a <EM>lightweight</EM> X.500 directory server.  That is, it does not implement the X.500's DAP.  As a <EM>lightweight directory</EM> server, <EM>slapd</EM>(8) implements only a subset of the X.500 models.</P>
<P>If you are already running a X.500 DAP service and you want to continue to do so, you can probably stop reading this guide.  This guide is all about running LDAP via <EM>slapd</EM>(8), without running X.500 DAP.  If you are not running X.500 DAP, want to stop running X.500 DAP, or have no immediate plans to run X.500 DAP, read on.</P>
<P>It is possible to replicate data from an LDAP directory server to a X.500 DAP <TERM>DSA</TERM>.  This requires an LDAP/DAP gateway. OpenLDAP does not provide such a gateway, but our replication daemon can be used to replicate to such a gateway.  See the <A HREF="#Replication with slurpd">Replication with slurpd</A> chapter of this document for information regarding replication.</P>
<H2><A NAME="What is the difference between LDAPv2 and LDAPv3">1.5. What is the difference between LDAPv2 and LDAPv3?</A></H2>
<P>LDAPv3 was developed in the late 1990's to replace LDAPv2. LDAPv3 adds the following features to LDAP:</P>
<UL><UL>
<LI>Strong Authentication via <TERM>SASL</TERM>
<LI>Integrity and Confidentiality Protection via <TERM>TLS</TERM> (SSL)
<LI>Internationalization through the use of Unicode
<LI>Referrals and Continuations
<LI>Schema Discovery
<LI>Extensibility (controls, extended operations, and more)</UL></UL>
<P>LDAPv2 is considered historical.  As deploying both LDAPv2 and LDAPv3 simultaneously can be quite problematic, LDAPv2 should be avoided.  LDAPv2 is disabled by default.</P>
<H2><A NAME="What is slapd and what can it do">1.6. What is slapd and what can it do?</A></H2>
<P><EM>slapd</EM>(8) is an LDAP directory server that runs on many different platforms. You can use it to provide a directory service of your very own.  Your directory can contain pretty much anything you want to put in it. You can connect it to the global LDAP directory service, or run a service all by yourself. Some of slapd's more interesting features and capabilities include:</P>
<P><B>LDAPv3</B>: <EM>slapd</EM> implements version 3 of <TERM>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol</TERM>. <EM>slapd</EM> supports LDAP over both IPv4 and IPv6.</P>
<P><B><TERM>Simple Authentication and Security Layer</TERM></B>: <EM>slapd</EM> supports strong authentication services through the use of SASL.  <EM>slapd</EM>'s SASL implementation utilizes <A HREF="http://asg.web.cmu.edu/cyrus/">Cyrus</A> <A HREF="http://asg.web.cmu.edu/sasl/sasl-library.html">SASL</A> software which supports a number of mechanisms including DIGEST-MD5, EXTERNAL, and GSSAPI.</P>
<P><B><TERM>Transport Layer Security</TERM></B>: <EM>slapd</EM> provides privacy and integrity protections through the use of TLS (or SSL).  <EM>slapd</EM>'s TLS implementation utilizes <A HREF="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</A> software.</P>
<P><B>Topology control</B>: <EM>slapd</EM> allows one to restrict access to the server based upon network topology.  This feature utilizes <EM>TCP wrappers</EM>.</P>
<P><B>Access control</B>: <EM>slapd</EM> provides a rich and powerful access control facility, allowing you to control access to the information in your database(s). You can control access to entries based on LDAP authorization information, <TERM>IP</TERM> address, domain name and other criteria.  <EM>slapd</EM> supports both <EM>static</EM> and <EM>dynamic</EM> access control information.</P>
<P><B>Internationalization</B>: <EM>slapd</EM> supports Unicode and language tags.</P>
<P><B>Choice of database backends</B>: <EM>slapd</EM> comes with a variety of different database backends you can choose from. They include <TERM>BDB</TERM>, a high-performance transactional database backend; <TERM>LDBM</TERM>, a lightweight DBM based backend; <EM>SHELL</EM>, a backend interface to arbitrary shell scripts; and PASSWD, a simple backend interface to the <EM>passwd</EM>(5) file.  BDB utilizes <A HREF="http://www.sleepycat.com/">Sleepycat</A> <A HREF="http://www.sleepycat.com/">Berkeley DB</A>.  LDBM utilizes either <A HREF="http://www.sleepycat.com/">Berkeley DB</A> or <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdbm/">GDBM</A>.</P>
<P><B>Multiple database instances</B>: <EM>slapd</EM> can be configured to serve multiple databases at the same time. This means that a single <EM>slapd</EM> server can respond to requests for many logically different portions of the LDAP tree, using the same or different database backends.</P>
<P><B>Generic modules API</B>: If you require even more customization, <EM>slapd</EM> lets you write your own modules easily. <EM>slapd</EM> consists of two distinct parts: a front end that handles protocol communication with LDAP clients; and modules which handle specific tasks such as database operations. Because these two pieces communicate via a well-defined <TERM>C</TERM> <TERM>API</TERM>, you can write your own customized modules which extend <EM>slapd</EM> in numerous ways.  Also, a number of <EM>programmable database</EM> modules are provided.  These allow you to expose external data sources to <EM>slapd</EM> using popular programming languages (<A HREF="http://www.perl.com/">Perl</A>, <EM>shell</EM>, <A HREF="http://www.jcc.com/SQLPages/jccs_sql.htm">SQL</A>, and <A HREF="http://tcl.activestate.com/">TCL</A>).</P>
<P><B>Threads</B>: <EM>slapd</EM> is threaded for high performance.  A single multi-threaded <EM>slapd</EM> process handles all incoming requests using a pool of threads.  This reduces the amount of system overhead required while providing high performance.</P>
<P><B>Replication</B>: <EM>slapd</EM> can be configured to maintain replica copies of its database. This <EM>single-master/multiple-slave</EM> replication scheme is vital in high-volume environments where a single <EM>slapd</EM> just doesn't provide the necessary availability or reliability.  <EM>slapd</EM> also includes experimental support for <EM>multi-master</EM> replication.</P>
<P><B>Configuration</B>: <EM>slapd</EM> is highly configurable through a single configuration file which allows you to change just about everything you'd ever want to change.  Configuration options have reasonable defaults, making your job much easier.</P>
<P><EM>slapd</EM> also has its limitations, of course.  The main BDB backend does not handle range queries or negation queries very well.</P>
<H2><A NAME="What is slurpd and what can it do">1.7. What is slurpd and what can it do?</A></H2>
<P><EM>slurpd</EM>(8) is a daemon that helps <EM>slapd</EM> provide replicated service. It is responsible for distributing changes made to the master <EM>slapd</EM> database out to the various <EM>slapd</EM> replicas. It frees <EM>slapd</EM> from having to worry that some replicas might be down or unreachable when a change comes through; <EM>slurpd</EM> handles retrying failed requests automatically.  <EM>slapd</EM> and <EM>slurpd</EM> communicate through a simple text file that is used to log changes.</P>
<P>See the <A HREF="#Replication with slurpd">Replication with slurpd</A> chapter for information about how to configure and run <EM>slurpd</EM>(8).</P>

<LI><B>Get the software</B>
<BR>
You can obtain a copy of the software by following the instructions on the OpenLDAP download page (<A HREF="http://www.openldap.org/software/download/">http://www.openldap.org/software/download/</A>).  It is recommended that new users start with the latest <EM>release</EM>.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<LI><B>Unpack the distribution</B>
<BR>
Pick a directory for the source to live under, change directory to there, and unpack the distribution using the following commands:<UL>
<TT>gunzip -c openldap-VERSION.tgz | tar xvfB -</TT></UL>
<BR>
then relocate yourself into the distribution directory:<UL>
<TT>cd openldap-VERSION</TT></UL>
<BR>
You'll have to replace <TT>VERSION</TT> with the version name of the release.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<LI><B>Review documentation</B>
<BR>
You should now review the <TT>COPYRIGHT</TT>, <TT>LICENSE</TT>, <TT>README</TT> and <TT>INSTALL</TT> documents provided with the distribution. The <TT>COPYRIGHT</TT> and <TT>LICENSE</TT> provide information on acceptable use, copying, and limitation of warranty of OpenLDAP software.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
You should also review other chapters of this document. In particular, the <A HREF="#Building and Installing OpenLDAP Software">Building and Installing OpenLDAP Software</A> chapter of this document provides detailed information on prerequisite software and installation procedures.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<LI><B>Run <TT>configure</TT></B>
<BR>
You will need to run the provided <TT>configure</TT> script to <EM>configure</EM> the distribution for building on your system.  The <TT>configure</TT> script accepts many command line options that enable or disable optional software features.  Usually the defaults are okay, but you may want to change them.  To get a complete list of options that <TT>configure</TT> accepts, use the <TT>--help</TT> option:<UL>
<TT>./configure --help</TT></UL>
<BR>
However, given that you are using this guide, we'll assume you are brave enough to just let <TT>configure</TT> determine what's best:<UL>
<TT>./configure</TT></UL>
<BR>
Assuming <TT>configure</TT> doesn't dislike your system, you can proceed with building the software.  If <TT>configure</TT> did complain, well, you'll likely need to go to the FAQ Installation Section (<A HREF="http://www.openldap.org/faq/">http://www.openldap.org/faq/</A> and/or actually read the <A HREF="#Building and Installing OpenLDAP Software">Building and Installing OpenLDAP Software</A> chapter of this document.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<LI><B>Build the software</B>.
<BR>
The next step is to build the software.  This step has two parts, first we construct dependencies and then we compile the software:<UL>
<TT>make depend</TT>
<BR>
<TT>make</TT></UL>
<BR>
Both makes should complete without error.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<LI><B>Test the build</B>.
<BR>
To ensure a correct build, you should run the test suite (it only takes a few minutes):<UL>
<TT>make test</TT></UL>
<BR>
Tests which apply to your configuration will run and they should pass.  Some tests, such as the replication test, may be skipped.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<LI><B>Install the software</B>.
<BR>
You are now ready to install the software; this usually requires <EM>super-user</EM> privileges:<UL>
<TT>su root -c 'make install'</TT></UL>
<BR>
Everything should now be installed under <TT>/usr/local</TT> (or whatever installation prefix was used by <TT>configure</TT>).
<BR>
&nbsp;
<LI><B>Edit the configuration file</B>.
<BR>
Use your favorite editor to edit the provided <EM>slapd.conf</EM>(5) example (usually installed as <TT>/usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.conf</TT>) to contain a BDB database definition of the form:<UL>
<TT>database        bdb</TT>
<BR>
<TT>suffix          &quot;dc=&lt;MY-DOMAIN&gt;,dc=&lt;COM&gt;&quot;</TT>
<BR>
<TT>rootdn          &quot;cn=Manager,dc=&lt;MY-DOMAIN&gt;,dc=&lt;COM&gt;&quot;</TT>
<BR>
<TT>rootpw          secret</TT>
<BR>
<TT>directory       /usr/local/var/openldap-data</TT></UL>
<BR>
Be sure to replace <TT>&lt;MY-DOMAIN&gt;</TT> and <TT>&lt;COM&gt;</TT> with the appropriate domain components of your domain name.  For example, for <TT>example.com</TT>, use:<UL>
<TT>database        bdb</TT>
<BR>
<TT>suffix          &quot;dc=example,dc=com&quot;</TT>
<BR>
<TT>rootdn          &quot;cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com&quot;</TT>
<BR>
<TT>rootpw          secret</TT>
<BR>
<TT>directory       /usr/local/var/openldap-data</TT></UL>
<BR>
If your domain contains additional components, such as <TT>eng.uni.edu.eu</TT>, use:<UL>
<TT>database        bdb</TT>
<BR>
<TT>suffix          &quot;dc=eng,dc=uni,dc=edu,dc=eu&quot;</TT>
<BR>
<TT>rootdn          &quot;cn=Manager,dc=eng,dc=uni,dc=edu,dc=eu&quot;</TT>

<LI><B>Start SLAPD</B>.
<BR>
You are now ready to start the stand-alone LDAP server, <EM>slapd</EM>(8), by running the command:<UL>
<TT>su root -c /usr/local/libexec/slapd</TT></UL>
<BR>
To check to see if the server is running and configured correctly, you can run a search against it with <EM>ldapsearch</EM>(1).  By default, ldapsearch is installed as <TT>/usr/local/bin/ldapsearch</TT>:<UL>
<TT>ldapsearch -x -b '' -s base '(objectclass=*)' namingContexts</TT></UL>
<BR>
Note the use of single quotes around command parameters to prevent special characters from being interpreted by the shell.  This should return:<UL>
<TT>dn:</TT>
<BR>
<TT>namingContexts: dc=example,dc=com</TT></UL>
<BR>
Details regarding running <EM>slapd</EM>(8) can be found in the <EM>slapd</EM>(8) manual page and the <A HREF="#Running slapd">Running slapd</A> chapter of this document.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<LI><B>Add initial entries to your directory</B>.
<BR>
You can use <EM>ldapadd</EM>(1) to add entries to your LDAP directory. <EM>ldapadd</EM> expects input in LDIF form. We'll do it in two steps:<OL>
<LI>create an LDIF file
<LI>run ldapadd</OL>
<BR>
Use your favorite editor and create an LDIF file that contains:<UL>
<TT>dn: dc=&lt;MY-DOMAIN&gt;,dc=&lt;COM&gt;</TT>
<BR>
<TT>objectclass: dcObject</TT>
<BR>
<TT>objectclass: organization</TT>
<BR>
<TT>o: &lt;MY ORGANIZATION&gt;</TT>
<BR>
<TT>dc: &lt;MY-DOMAIN&gt;</TT>
<BR>
<TT></TT>
<BR>
<TT>dn: cn=Manager,dc=&lt;MY-DOMAIN&gt;,dc=&lt;COM&gt;</TT>
<BR>
<TT>objectclass: organizationalRole</TT>
<BR>
<TT>cn: Manager</TT></UL>
<BR>
Be sure to replace <TT>&lt;MY-DOMAIN&gt;</TT> and <TT>&lt;COM&gt;</TT> with the appropriate domain components of your domain name.  <TT>&lt;MY ORGANIZATION&gt;</TT> should be replaced with the name of your organization. When you cut and paste, be sure to trim any leading and trailing whitespace from the example.<UL>
<TT>dn: dc=example,dc=com</TT>
<BR>
<TT>objectclass: dcObject</TT>
<BR>
<TT>objectclass: organization</TT>
<BR>
<TT>o: Example Company</TT>

<BR>
<TT>dn: cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com</TT>
<BR>
<TT>objectclass: organizationalRole</TT>
<BR>
<TT>cn: Manager</TT></UL>
<BR>
Now, you may run <EM>ldapadd</EM>(1) to insert these entries into your directory.<UL>
<TT>ldapadd -x -D &quot;cn=Manager,dc=&lt;MY-DOMAIN&gt;,dc=&lt;COM&gt;&quot; -W -f example.ldif</TT></UL>
<BR>
Be sure to replace <TT>&lt;MY-DOMAIN&gt;</TT> and <TT>&lt;COM&gt;</TT> with the appropriate domain components of your domain name.  You will be prompted for the &quot;<TT>secret</TT>&quot; specified in <TT>slapd.conf</TT>. For example, for <TT>example.com</TT>, use:<UL>
<TT>ldapadd -x -D &quot;cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com&quot; -W -f example.ldif</TT></UL>
<BR>
where <TT>example.ldif</TT> is the file you created above.<UL>
<TT> </TT></UL>
<BR>
Additional information regarding directory creation can be found in the <A HREF="#Database Creation and Maintenance Tools">Database Creation and Maintenance Tools</A> chapter of this document.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<LI><B>See if it works</B>.
<BR>
Now we're ready to verify the added entries are in your directory. You can use any LDAP client to do this, but our example uses the <EM>ldapsearch</EM>(1) tool.  Remember to replace <TT>dc=example,dc=com</TT> with the correct values for your site:<UL>
<TT>ldapsearch -x -b 'dc=example,dc=com' '(objectclass=*)'</TT></UL>
<BR>
This command will search for and retrieve every entry in the database.</OL>
<P>You are now ready to add more entries using <EM>ldapadd</EM>(1) or another LDAP client, experiment with various configuration options, backend arrangements, etc.</P>
<P>Note that by default, the <EM>slapd</EM>(8) database grants <EM>read access to everybody</EM> excepting the <EM>super-user</EM> (as specified by the <TT>rootdn</TT> configuration directive).  It is highly recommended that you establish controls to restrict access to authorized users. Access controls are discussed in the <A HREF="#Access Control">Access Control</A> section of <A HREF="#The slapd Configuration File">The slapd Configuration File</A> chapter.  You are also encouraged to read the <A HREF="#Security Considerations">Security Considerations</A>, <A HREF="#Using SASL">Using SASL</A> and <A HREF="#Using TLS">Using TLS</A> sections.</P>
<P>The following chapters provide more detailed information on making, installing, and running <EM>slapd</EM>(8).</P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="The Big Picture - Configuration Choices">3. The Big Picture - Configuration Choices</A></H1>
<P>This section gives a brief overview of various <TERM>LDAP</TERM> directory configurations, and how your stand-alone LDAP server <EM>slapd</EM>(8) fits in with the rest of the world.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Local Directory Service">3.1. Local Directory Service</A></H2>
<P>In this configuration, you run a <EM>slapd</EM> which provides directory service for your local domain only. It does not interact with other directory servers in any way. This configuration is shown in Figure 3.1.</P>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="config_local.gif" ALIGN="center"></CENTER></P>
<P ALIGN="Center">Figure 3.1: Local service configuration.</P>
<P>Use this configuration if you are just starting out (it's the one the quick-start guide makes for you) or if you want to provide a local service and are not interested in connecting to the rest of the world. It's easy to upgrade to another configuration later if you want.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Local Directory Service with Referrals">3.2. Local Directory Service with Referrals</A></H2>
<P>In this configuration, you run a slapd which provides directory service for your local domain and configure it to return referrals to a <EM>superior</EM> service capable of handling requests outside your local domain. You may run this service yourself or use one provided to you. This configuration is shown in Figure 3.2.</P>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="config_ref.gif" ALIGN="center"></CENTER></P>
<P ALIGN="Center">Figure 3.2: Local service with referrals</P>
<P>Use this configuration if you want to provide local service and participate in the Global Directory.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Replicated Directory Service">3.3. Replicated Directory Service</A></H2>
<P>The slurpd daemon is used to propagate changes from a master slapd to one or more slave slapds. An example master-slave configuration is shown in figure 3.3.</P>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="config_repl.gif" ALIGN="center"></CENTER></P>
<P ALIGN="Center">Figure 3.3: Replicated Directory Services</P>
<P>This configuration can be used in conjunction with either of the first two configurations in situations where a single slapd does not provide the required reliability or availability.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Distributed Local Directory Service">3.4. Distributed Local Directory Service</A></H2>
<P>In this configuration, the local service is partitioned into smaller services, each of which may be replicated, and <EM>glued</EM> together with <EM>superior</EM> and <EM>subordinate</EM> referrals.</P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="Building and Installing OpenLDAP Software">4. Building and Installing OpenLDAP Software</A></H1>
<P>This chapter details how to build and install the <A HREF="http://www.openldap.org/">OpenLDAP</A> Software package including <EM>slapd</EM>(8), the stand-alone LDAP daemon and <EM>slurpd</EM>(8), the stand-alone update replication daemon. Building and installing OpenLDAP Software requires several steps: installing prerequisite software, configuring OpenLDAP Software itself, making, and finally installing.  The following sections describe this process in detail.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Obtaining and Extracting the Software">4.1. Obtaining and Extracting the Software</A></H2>
<P>You can obtain OpenLDAP Software from the project's download page at <A HREF="http://www.openldap.org/software/download/">http://www.openldap.org/software/download/</A> or directly from the project's <TERM>FTP</TERM> service at <A HREF="ftp://ftp.openldap.org/pub/OpenLDAP/">ftp://ftp.openldap.org/pub/OpenLDAP/</A>.</P>
<P>The project makes available two series of packages for <EM>general use</EM>.  The project makes <EM>releases</EM> as new features and bug fixes come available.  Though the project takes steps to improve stablity of these releases, it is common for problems to arise only after <EM>release</EM>.  The <EM>stable</EM> release is the latest <EM>release</EM> which has demonstrated stability through general use.</P>
<P>Users of OpenLDAP Software can choose, depending on their desire for the <EM>latest features</EM> versus <EM>demonstrated stability</EM>, the most appropriate series to install.</P>
<P>After downloading OpenLDAP Software, you need to extract the distribution from the compressed archive file and change your working directory to the top directory of the distribution:</P>
<UL>
<TT>gunzip -c openldap-VERSION.tgz | tar xf -</TT>
<BR>
<TT>cd openldap-VERSION</TT></UL>
<P>You'll have to replace <TT>VERSION</TT> with the version name of the release.</P>
<P>You should now review the <TT>COPYRIGHT</TT>, <TT>LICENSE</TT>, <TT>README</TT> and <TT>INSTALL</TT> documents provided with the distribution.  The <TT>COPYRIGHT</TT> and <TT>LICENSE</TT> provide information on acceptable use, copying, and limitation of warranty of OpenLDAP Software. The <TT>README</TT> and <TT>INSTALL</TT> documents provide detailed information on prerequisite software and installation procedures.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Prerequisite software">4.2. Prerequisite software</A></H2>
<P>OpenLDAP Software relies upon a number of software packages distributed by third parties.  Depending on the features you intend to use, you may have to download and install a number of additional software packages.  This section details commonly needed third party software packages you might have to install.  Note that some of these third party packages may depend on additional software packages.  Install each package per the installation instructions provided with it.</P>
<H3><A NAME="{{TERM[expand]TLS}}">4.2.1. <TERM>Transport Layer Security</TERM></A></H3>
<P>OpenLDAP clients and servers require installation of <A HREF="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</A> <TERM>TLS</TERM> libraries to provide <TERM>Transport Layer Security</TERM> services.  Though some operating systems may provide these libraries as part of the base system or as an optional software component, OpenSSL often requires separate installation.</P>
<P>OpenSSL is available from <A HREF="http://www.openssl.org/">http://www.openssl.org/</A>.</P>
<P>OpenLDAP Software will not be fully LDAPv3 compliant unless OpenLDAP's <TT>configure</TT> detects a usable OpenSSL installation.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Kerberos Authentication Services">4.2.2. Kerberos Authentication Services</A></H3>
<P>OpenLDAP clients and servers support Kerberos-based authentication services. In particular, OpenLDAP supports the <TERM>SASL</TERM>/<TERM>GSSAPI</TERM> authentication mechanism using either <A HREF="http://www.pdc.kth.se/heimdal/">Heimdal</A> or <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/">MIT Kerberos</A> V packages. If you desire to use Kerberos-based SASL/GSSAPI authentication, you should install either Heimdal or MIT Kerberos V.</P>
<P>Heimdal Kerberos is available from <A HREF="http://www.pdc.kth.se/heimdal/">http://www.pdc.kth.se/heimdal/</A>. MIT Kerberos is available from <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/">http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/</A>.</P>
<P>Use of strong authentication services, such as those provided by Kerberos, is highly recommended.</P>
<H3><A NAME="{{TERM[expand]SASL}}">4.2.3. <TERM>Simple Authentication and Security Layer</TERM></A></H3>
<P>OpenLDAP clients and servers require installation of <A HREF="http://asg.web.cmu.edu/cyrus/">Cyrus</A>'s <A HREF="http://asg.web.cmu.edu/sasl/sasl-library.html">SASL</A> libraries to provide <TERM>Simple Authentication and Security Layer</TERM> services.  Though some operating systems may provide this library as part of the base system or as an optional software component, Cyrus SASL often requires separate installation.</P>
<P>Cyrus SASL is available from <A HREF="http://asg.web.cmu.edu/sasl/sasl-library.html">http://asg.web.cmu.edu/sasl/sasl-library.html</A>. Cyrus SASL will make use of OpenSSL and Kerberos/GSSAPI libraries if preinstalled.</P>
<P>OpenLDAP Software will not be fully LDAPv3 compliant unless OpenLDAP's configure detects a usable Cyrus SASL installation.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Database Software">4.2.4. Database Software</A></H3>
<P>OpenLDAP's <EM>slapd</EM>(8) primary database backend, <TERM>BDB</TERM>, requires <A HREF="http://www.sleepycat.com/">Sleepycat Software</A> <A HREF="http://www.sleepycat.com/">Berkeley DB</A>, version 4. If not available at configure time, you will not be able build <EM>slapd</EM>(8) with this primary database backend.</P>
<P>Your operating system may provide <A HREF="http://www.sleepycat.com/">Berkeley DB</A>, version 4, in the base system or as an optional software component.  If not, you'll have to obtain and install it yourself.</P>
<P><A HREF="http://www.sleepycat.com/">Berkeley DB</A> is available from <A HREF="http://www.sleepycat.com/">Sleepycat Software</A>'s download page <A HREF="http://www.sleepycat.com/download.html">http://www.sleepycat.com/download.html</A>. There are several versions available.  At the time of this writing, the latest release, version 4.1, is recommended. This package is required if you wish to use the <TERM>BDB</TERM> database backend.</P>
<P>OpenLDAP's <EM>slapd</EM>(8) LDBM backend supports a variety of data base managers including <A HREF="http://www.sleepycat.com/">Berkeley DB</A> and <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdbm/">GDBM</A>. <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdbm/">GDBM</A> is available from <A HREF="http://www.fsf.org/">FSF</A>'s download site <A HREF="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gdbm/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gdbm/</A>.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Threads">4.2.5. Threads</A></H3>
<P>OpenLDAP is designed to take advantage of threads.  OpenLDAP supports POSIX <EM>pthreads</EM>, Mach <EM>CThreads</EM>, and a number of other varieties.  <TT>configure</TT> will complain if it cannot find a suitable thread subsystem.   If this occurs, please consult the <TT>Software|Installation|Platform Hints</TT> section of the OpenLDAP FAQ <A HREF="http://www.openldap.org/faq/">http://www.openldap.org/faq/</A>.</P>
<H3><A NAME="TCP Wrappers">4.2.6. TCP Wrappers</A></H3>
<P><EM>slapd</EM>(8) supports TCP Wrappers (IP level access control filters) if preinstalled.  Use of TCP Wrappers or other IP-level access filters (such as those provided by an IP-level firewall) is recommended for servers containing non-public information.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Running configure">4.3. Running configure</A></H2>
<P>Now you should probably run the <TT>configure</TT> script with the <TT>--help</TT> option. This will give you a list of options that you can change when building OpenLDAP.  Many of the features of OpenLDAP can be enabled or disabled using this method.</P>
<PRE>
        ./configure --help
</PRE>
<P>The <TT>configure</TT> script will also look at various environment variables for certain settings.  These environment variables include:</P>

</TABLE>

<P>Now run the configure script with any desired configuration options or environment variables.</P>
<PRE>
        [[env] settings] ./configure [options]
</PRE>
<P>As an example, let's assume that we want to install OpenLDAP with BDB backend and TCP Wrappers support.  By default, BDB is enabled and TCP Wrappers is not.  So, we just need to specify <TT>--with-wrappers</TT> to include TCP Wrappers support:</P>
<PRE>
        ./configure --with-wrappers
</PRE>
<P>However, this will fail to locate dependent software not installed in system directories.  For example, if TCP Wrappers headers and libraries are installed in <TT>/usr/local/include</TT> and <TT>/usr/local/lib</TT> respectively, the <TT>configure</TT> script should be called as follows:</P>
<PRE>
        env CPPFLAGS=&quot;-I/usr/local/include&quot; LDFLAGS=&quot;-L/usr/local/lib&quot; \
                ./configure --with-wrappers
</PRE>
<P><HR WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="Left">
<STRONG>Note: </STRONG>Some shells, such as those derived from the Bourne <EM>sh</EM>(1), do not require use of the <EM>env</EM>(1) command.  In some cases, environmental variables have to be specified using alternative syntaxes.
<HR WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="Left"></P>
<P>The <TT>configure</TT> script will normally auto-detect appropriate settings.  If you have problems at this stage, consult any platform specific hints and check your <TT>configure</TT> options, if any.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Building the Software">4.4. Building the Software</A></H2>
<P>Once you have run the <TT>configure</TT> script the last line of output should be:</P>
<PRE>
        Please &quot;make depend&quot; to build dependencies
</PRE>
<P>If the last line of output does not match, <TT>configure</TT> has failed, and you will need to review its output to determine what went wrong. You should not proceed until <TT>configure</TT> completes successfully.</P>
<P>To build dependencies, run:</P>
<PRE>
        make depend
</PRE>
<P>Now build the software, this step will actually compile OpenLDAP.</P>
<PRE>
        make
</PRE>
<P>You should examine the output of this command carefully to make sure everything is built correctly. Note that this command builds the LDAP libraries and associated clients as well as <EM>slapd</EM>(8) and <EM>slurpd</EM>(8).</P>
<H2><A NAME="Testing the Software">4.5. Testing the Software</A></H2>
<P>Once the software has been properly configured and successfully made, you should run the test suite to verify the build.</P>
<PRE>
        make test
</PRE>
<P>Tests which apply to your configuration will run and they should pass. Some tests, such as the replication test, may be skipped if not supported by your configuration.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Installing the Software">4.6. Installing the Software</A></H2>
<P>Once you have successfully tested the software, you are ready to install it.  You will need to have write permission to the installation directories you specified when you ran configure.  By default OpenLDAP Software is installed in <TT>/usr/local</TT>.  If you changed this setting with the <TT>--prefix</TT> configure option, it will be installed in the location you provided.</P>
<P>Typically, the installation requires <EM>super-user</EM> privileges. From the top level OpenLDAP source directory, type:</P>
<PRE>
        su root -c 'make install'
</PRE>
<P>and enter the appropriate password when requested.</P>
<P>You should examine the output of this command carefully to make sure everything is installed correctly. You will find the configuration files for <EM>slapd</EM>(8) in <TT>/usr/local/etc/openldap</TT> by default.  See the chapter <A HREF="#The slapd Configuration File">The slapd Configuration File</A> for additional information.</P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="The slapd Configuration File">5. The slapd Configuration File</A></H1>
<P>Once the software has been built and installed, you are ready to configure <EM>slapd</EM>(8) for use at your site. The slapd runtime configuration is primarily accomplished through the <EM>slapd.conf</EM>(5) file, normally installed in the <TT>/usr/local/etc/openldap</TT> directory.</P>
<P>An alternate configuration file can be specified via a command-line option to <EM>slapd</EM>(8) or <EM>slurpd</EM>(8). This chapter describes the general format of the config file, followed by a detailed description of commonly used config file directives.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Configuration File Format">5.1. Configuration File Format</A></H2>
<P>The <EM>slapd.conf</EM>(5) file consists of three types of configuration information: global, backend specific, and database specific.  Global information is specified first, followed by information associated with a particular backend type, which is then followed by information associated with a particular database instance.  Global directives can be overridden in backend and/or database directives, and backend directives can be overridden by database directives.</P>
<P>Blank lines and comment lines beginning with a '<TT>#</TT>' character are ignored.  If a line begins with white space, it is considered a continuation of the previous line. The general format of slapd.conf is as follows:</P>
<PRE>
        # global configuration directives
        &lt;global config directives&gt;

        # backend definition
        backend &lt;typeA&gt;
        &lt;backend-specific directives&gt;

        # first database definition &amp; config directives
        database &lt;typeA&gt;
        &lt;database-specific directives&gt;

        # second database definition &amp; config directives
        database &lt;typeB&gt;
        &lt;database-specific directives&gt;

        # second database definition &amp; config directives
        database &lt;typeA&gt;
        &lt;database-specific directives&gt;

        # subsequent backend &amp; database definitions &amp; config directives
        ...
</PRE>
<P>A configuration directive may take arguments.  If so, they are separated by white space.  If an argument contains white space, the argument should be enclosed in double quotes <TT>&quot;like this&quot;</TT>. If an argument contains a double quote or a backslash character `<TT>\</TT>', the character should be preceded by a backslash character `<TT>\</TT>'.</P>
<P>The distribution contains an example configuration file that will be installed in the <TT>/usr/local/etc/openldap</TT> directory. A number of files containing schema definitions (attribute types and object classes) are also provided in the <TT>/usr/local/etc/openldap/schema</TT> directory.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Configuration File Directives">5.2. Configuration File Directives</A></H2>
<P>This section details commonly used configuration directives.  For a complete list, see the <EM>slapd.conf</EM>(5) manual page.  This section separates the configuration file directives into global, backend-specific and data-specific categories, describing each directive and its default value (if any), and giving an example of its use.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Global Directives">5.2.1. Global Directives</A></H3>
<P>Directives described in this section apply to all backends and databases unless specifically overridden in a backend or database definition.  Arguments that should be replaced by actual text are shown in brackets <TT>&lt;&gt;</TT>.</P>

<H4><A NAME="include &lt;filename&gt;">5.2.1.4. include &lt;filename&gt;</A></H4>
<P>This directive specifies that slapd should read additional configuration information from the given file before continuing with the next line of the current file. The included file should follow the normal slapd config file format.  The file is commonly used to include files containing schema specifications.</P>
<P><HR WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="Left">
<STRONG>Note: </STRONG>You should be careful when using this directive - there is no small limit on the number of nested include directives, and no loop detection is done.

<H4><A NAME="loglevel &lt;integer&gt;">5.2.1.5. loglevel &lt;integer&gt;</A></H4>
<P>This directive specifies the level at which debugging statements and operation statistics should be syslogged (currently logged to the <EM>syslogd</EM>(8) <TT>LOG_LOCAL4</TT> facility). You must have configured OpenLDAP <TT>--enable-debug</TT> (the default) for this to work (except for the two statistics levels, which are always enabled).  Log levels are additive.

                [credentials=&lt;password&gt;]
                [srvtab=&lt;filename&gt;]
</PRE>
<P>This directive specifies a replication site for this database. The <TT>host=</TT> parameter specifies a host and optionally a port where the slave slapd instance can be found. Either a domain name or IP address may be used for &lt;hostname&gt;. If &lt;port&gt; is not given, the standard LDAP port number (389) is used.</P>
<P>The <TT>binddn=</TT> parameter gives the DN to bind as for updates to the slave slapd. It should be a DN which has read/write access to the slave slapd's database, typically given as a <TT>rootdn</TT> in the slave's config file. It must also match the <TT>updatedn</TT> directive in the slave slapd's config file. Since DNs are likely to contain embedded spaces, the entire <TT>&quot;binddn=&lt;DN&gt;&quot;</TT> string should be enclosed in double quotes.</P>
<P>The <TT>bindmethod</TT> is <TT>simple</TT> or <TT>kerberos</TT> or <TT>sasl</TT>, depending on whether simple password-based authentication or Kerberos authentication or <TERM>SASL</TERM> authentication is to be used when connecting to the slave slapd.</P>
<P>Simple authentication should not be used unless adequate integrity and privacy protections are in place (e.g. TLS or IPSEC).  Simple authentication requires specification of <TT>binddn</TT> and <TT>credentials</TT> parameters.</P>
<P>Kerberos authentication is deprecated in favor of SASL authentication mechanisms, in particular the <TT>KERBEROS_V4</TT> and <TT>GSSAPI</TT> mechanisms.  Kerberos authentication requires <TT>binddn</TT> and <TT>srvtab</TT> parameters.</P>
<P>SASL authentication is generally recommended.  SASL authentication requires specification of a mechanism using the <TT>mech</TT> parameter. Depending on the mechanism, an authentication identity and/or credentials can be specified using <TT>authcid</TT> and <TT>credentials</TT> respectively.  The <TT>authzid</TT> parameter may be used to specify an authorization identity.</P>
<P>See the chapter entitled <A HREF="#Replication with slurpd">Replication with slurpd</A> for more information on how to use this directive.</P>
<H4><A NAME="replogfile &lt;filename&gt;">5.2.3.4. replogfile &lt;filename&gt;</A></H4>
<P>This directive specifies the name of the replication log file to which slapd will log changes. The replication log is typically written by slapd and read by slurpd. Normally, this directive is only used if slurpd is being used to replicate the database. However, you can also use it to generate a transaction log, if slurpd is not running. In this case, you will need to periodically truncate the file, since it will grow indefinitely otherwise.</P>
<P>See the chapter entitled <A HREF="#Replication with slurpd">Replication with slurpd</A> for more information on how to use this directive.</P>
<H4><A NAME="rootdn &lt;dn&gt;">5.2.3.5. rootdn &lt;dn&gt;</A></H4>
<P>This directive specifies the DN that is not subject to access control or administrative limit restrictions for operations on this database.  The DN need not refer to an entry in this database or even in the directory. The DN may refer to a SASL identity.</P>
<P>Entry-based Example:</P>
<PRE>
        rootdn &quot;cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com&quot;
</PRE>
<P>SASL-based Example:</P>
<PRE>
        rootdn &quot;uid=root,cn=example.com,cn=digest-md5,cn=auth&quot;
</PRE>
<P>See the <A HREF="#SASL Authentication">SASL Authentication</A> section for information on SASL authentication identities.</P>
<H4><A NAME="rootpw &lt;password&gt;">5.2.3.6. rootpw &lt;password&gt;</A></H4>
<P>This directive can be used to specifies a password for the DN for the rootdn (when the rootdn is set to a DN within the database).</P>
<P>Example:</P>
<PRE>
        rootpw secret
</PRE>
<P>It is also permissible to provide hash of the password in RFC 2307 form.  <EM>slappasswd</EM>(8) may be used to generate the password hash.</P>
<P>Example:</P>
<PRE>
        rootpw {SSHA}ZKKuqbEKJfKSXhUbHG3fG8MDn9j1v4QN
</PRE>
<P>The hash was generated using the command <TT>slappasswd -s secret</TT>.</P>
<H4><A NAME="suffix &lt;dn suffix&gt;">5.2.3.7. suffix &lt;dn suffix&gt;</A></H4>
<P>This directive specifies the DN suffix of queries that will be passed to this backend database. Multiple suffix lines can be given, and at least one is required for each database definition.</P>
<P>Example:</P>
<PRE>
        suffix &quot;dc=example,dc=com&quot;
</PRE>
<P>Queries with a DN ending in &quot;dc=example,dc=com&quot; will be passed to this backend.</P>
<P><HR WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="Left">
<STRONG>Note: </STRONG>When the backend to pass a query to is selected, slapd looks at the suffix line(s) in each database definition in the order they appear in the file. Thus, if one database suffix is a prefix of another, it must appear after it in the config file.
<HR WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="Left"></P>
<H4><A NAME="updatedn &lt;dn&gt;">5.2.3.8. updatedn &lt;dn&gt;</A></H4>
<P>This directive is only applicable in a slave slapd. It specifies the DN allowed to make changes to the replica.  This may be the DN <EM>slurpd</EM>(8) binds as when making changes to the replica or the DN associated with a SASL identity.</P>
<P>Entry-based Example:</P>
<PRE>
        updatedn &quot;cn=Update Daemon,dc=example,dc=com&quot;
</PRE>
<P>SASL-based Example:</P>
<PRE>
        updatedn &quot;uid=slurpd,cn=example.com,cn=digest-md5,cn=auth&quot;
</PRE>
<P>See the <A HREF="#Replication with slurpd">Replication with slurpd</A> chapter for more information on how to use this directive.</P>
<H4><A NAME="updateref &lt;URL&gt;">5.2.3.9. updateref &lt;URL&gt;</A></H4>
<P>This directive is only applicable in a slave slapd. It specifies the URL to return to clients which submit update requests upon the replica. If specified multiple times, each <TERM>URL</TERM> is provided.</P>
<P>Example:</P>
<PRE>
        updateref       ldap://master.example.net
</PRE>
<H3><A NAME="BDB Database Directives">5.2.4. BDB Database Directives</A></H3>
<P>Directives in this category only apply to a <TERM>BDB</TERM> database. That is, they must follow a &quot;database bdb&quot; line and come before any subsequent &quot;backend&quot; or &quot;database&quot; line.  For a complete reference of BDB configuration directives, see <EM>slapd-bdb</EM>(5).</P>
<H4><A NAME="directory &lt;directory&gt;">5.2.4.1. directory &lt;directory&gt;</A></H4>

For a complete reference of LDBM configuration directives, see <EM>slapd-ldbm</EM>(5).</P>
<H4><A NAME="cachesize &lt;integer&gt;">5.2.5.1. cachesize &lt;integer&gt;</A></H4>
<P>This directive specifies the size in entries of the in-memory cache maintained by the LDBM backend database instance.</P>
<P>Default:</P>
<PRE>
        cachesize 1000
</PRE>
<H4><A NAME="dbcachesize &lt;integer&gt;">5.2.5.2. dbcachesize &lt;integer&gt;</A></H4>
<P>This directive specifies the size in bytes of the in-memory cache associated with each open index file. If not supported by the underlying database method, this directive is ignored without comment. Increasing this number uses more memory but can cause a dramatic performance increase, especially during modifies or when building indices.</P>
<P>Default:</P>
<PRE>
        dbcachesize 100000
</PRE>
<H4><A NAME="dbnolocking">5.2.5.3. dbnolocking</A></H4>
<P>This option, if present, disables database locking. Enabling this option may improve performance at the expense of data security.</P>
<H4><A NAME="dbnosync">5.2.5.4. dbnosync</A></H4>
<P>This option causes on-disk database contents to not be immediately synchronized with in memory changes upon change.  Enabling this option may improve performance at the expense of data integrity.</P>
<H4><A NAME="directory &lt;directory&gt;">5.2.5.5. directory &lt;directory&gt;</A></H4>
<P>This directive specifies the directory where the LDBM files containing the database and associated indices live.</P>
<P>Default:</P>
<PRE>
        directory /usr/local/var/openldap-data
</PRE>
<H4><A NAME="index {&lt;attrlist&gt; | default} [pres,eq,approx,sub,none]">5.2.5.6. index {&lt;attrlist&gt; | default} [pres,eq,approx,sub,none]</A></H4>
<P>This directive specifies the indices to maintain for the given attribute. If only an <TT>&lt;attrlist&gt;</TT> is given, the default indices are maintained.</P>
<P>Example:</P>
<PRE>
        index default pres,eq
        index uid
        index cn,sn pres,eq,sub
        index objectClass eq
</PRE>
<P>The first line sets the default set of indices to maintain to present and equality.  The second line causes the default (pres,eq) set of indices to be maintained for the <TT>uid</TT> attribute type. The third line causes present, equality, and substring indices to be maintained for <TT>cn</TT> and <TT>sn</TT> attribute types.  The fourth line causes an equality index for the <TT>objectClass</TT> attribute type.</P>
<P>By default, no indices are maintained.  It is generally advised that minimally an equality index upon objectClass be maintained.</P>
<PRE>
        index objectClass eq
</PRE>
<H4><A NAME="mode &lt;integer&gt;">5.2.5.7. mode &lt;integer&gt;</A></H4>

<P>where the &lt;what&gt; part selects the entries and/or attributes to which the access applies, the <TT>&lt;who&gt;</TT> part specifies which entities are granted access, and the <TT>&lt;access&gt;</TT> part specifies the access granted. Multiple <TT>&lt;who&gt; &lt;access&gt; &lt;control&gt;</TT> triplets are supported, allowing many entities to be granted different access to the same set of entries and attributes. Not all of these access control options are described here; for more details see the <EM>slapd.access</EM>(5) man page.</P>
<H3><A NAME="What to control access to">5.3.1. What to control access to</A></H3>
<P>The &lt;what&gt; part of an access specification determines the entries and attributes to which the access control applies.  Entries are commonly selected in two ways: by DN and by filter.  The following qualifiers select entries by DN:</P>
<PRE>
        by *
        by dn[.&lt;basic-style&gt;]=&lt;regex&gt;
        by dn.&lt;scope-style&gt;=&lt;DN&gt;
</PRE>
<P>The first form is used to select all entries.  The second form may be used to select entries by matching a regular expression against the target entry's <EM>normalized DN</EM>.   (The second form is not discussed further in this document.)  The third form is used to select entries which are within the requested scope of DN.  The &lt;DN&gt; is a string representation of the Distinguished Name, as described in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2253.txt">RFC2253</A>.</P>
<P>The scope can be either <TT>base</TT>, <TT>one</TT>, <TT>subtree</TT>, or <TT>children</TT>.  Where <TT>base</TT> matches only the entry with provided DN, <TT>one</TT> matches the entries whose parent is the provided DN, <TT>subtree</TT> matches all entries in the subtree whose root is the provided DN, and <TT>children</TT> matches all entries under the DN (but not the entry named by the DN).</P>
<P>For example, if the directory contained entries named:</P>
<PRE>
        0: o=suffix
        1: cn=Manager,o=suffix
        2: ou=people,o=suffix
        3: uid=kdz,ou=people,o=suffix
        4: cn=addresses,uid=kdz,ou=people,o=suffix
        5: uid=hyc,ou=people,o=suffix
</PRE>
<P>Then:</P>
<UL>
<TT>dn.base=&quot;ou=people,o=suffix&quot;</TT> match 2;
<BR>
<TT>dn.one=&quot;ou=people,o=suffix&quot;</TT> match 3, and 5;
<BR>
<TT>dn.subtree=&quot;ou=people,o=suffix&quot;</TT> match 2, 3, 4, and 5; and
<BR>
<TT>dn.children=&quot;ou=people,o=suffix&quot;</TT> match 3, 4, and 5.</UL>
<P>Entries may also be selected using a filter:</P>
<PRE>
        by filter=&lt;ldap filter&gt;
</PRE>
<P>where &lt;ldap filter&gt; is a string representation of an LDAP search filter, as described in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2254.txt">RFC2254</A>.  For example:</P>
<PRE>
        by filter=(objectClass=person)
</PRE>
<P>Note that entries by be select by both DN and filter by include both qualifiers in the &lt;what&gt; clause.</P>
<PRE>
        by dn.one=&quot;ou=people,o=suffix&quot; filter=(objectClass=person)
</PRE>
<P>Attributes within an entry are selected by including a comma-separated list of attribute names in the &lt;what&gt; selector:</P>
<PRE>
        attrs=&lt;attribute list&gt;
</PRE>
<P>There are two special <EM>psuedo</EM> attributes <TT>entry</TT> and <TT>children</TT>.  To read (and hence return) an target entry, the subject must have <TT>read</TT> access to the target's <EM>entry</EM> attribute.  To add or delete an entry, the subject must have <TT>write</TT> access to the entry's <TT>entry</TT> attribute AND must have <TT>write</TT> access to the entry's parent's <TT>children</TT> attribute.  To rename an entry, the subject must have <TT>write</TT> access to entry's <TT>entry</TT> attribute AND have <TT>write</TT> access to both the old parent's and new parent's <TT>children</TT> attributes.  The complete examples at the end of this section should help clear things up.</P>
<P>Lastly, there is a special entry selector <TT>&quot;*&quot;</TT> that is used to select any entry.  It is used when no other <TT>&lt;what&gt;</TT> selector has been provided.  It's equivalent to &quot;<TT>dn=.*</TT>&quot;</P>
<H3><A NAME="Who to grant access to">5.3.2. Who to grant access to</A></H3>
<P>The &lt;who&gt; part identifies the entity or entities being granted access. Note that access is granted to &quot;entities&quot; not &quot;entries.&quot; The following table summarizes entity specifiers:</P>

<P>The DN specifier behaves much like &lt;what&gt; clause DN specifiers.</P>
<P>Other control factors are also supported. For example, a <TT>&lt;who&gt;</TT> can be restricted by a regular expression matching the client's domain name:</P>
<PRE>
        domain=&lt;regular expression&gt;
</PRE>
<P>or by an entry listed in a DN-valued attribute in the entry to which the access applies:</P>
<PRE>
        dnattr=&lt;dn-valued attribute name&gt;
</PRE>
<P>The dnattr specification is used to give access to an entry whose DN is listed in an attribute of the entry (e.g., give access to a group entry to whoever is listed as the owner of the group entry).</P>

<P>Each level implies all lower levels of access. So, for example, granting someone <TT>write</TT> access to an entry also grants them <TT>read</TT>, <TT>search</TT>, <TT>compare</TT>, and <TT>auth</TT> access.  However, one may use the privileges specifier to grant specific permissions.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Access Control Evaluation">5.3.4. Access Control Evaluation</A></H3>
<P>When evaluating whether some requester should be given access to an entry and/or attribute, slapd compares the entry and/or attribute to the <TT>&lt;what&gt;</TT> selectors given in the configuration file. For each entry, access controls provided in the database which holds the entry (or the first database if not held in any database) apply first, followed by the global access directives.  Within this priority, access directives are examined in the order in which they appear in the config file.  Slapd stops with the first <TT>&lt;what&gt;</TT> selector that matches the entry and/or attribute. The corresponding access directive is the one slapd will use to evaluate access.</P>
<P>Next, slapd compares the entity requesting access to the <TT>&lt;who&gt;</TT> selectors within the access directive selected above in the order in which they appear. It stops with the first <TT>&lt;who&gt;</TT> selector that matches the requester. This determines the access the entity requesting access has to the entry and/or attribute.</P>
<P>Finally, slapd compares the access granted in the selected <TT>&lt;access&gt;</TT> clause to the access requested by the client. If it allows greater or equal access, access is granted. Otherwise, access is denied.</P>
<P>The order of evaluation of access directives makes their placement in the configuration file important. If one access directive is more specific than another in terms of the entries it selects, it should appear first in the config file. Similarly, if one <TT>&lt;who&gt;</TT> selector is more specific than another it should come first in the access directive. The access control examples given below should help make this clear.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Access Control Examples">5.3.5. Access Control Examples</A></H3>
<P>The access control facility described above is quite powerful. This section shows some examples of its use. First, some simple examples:</P>
<PRE>
        access to * by * read
</PRE>
<P>This access directive grants read access to everyone.</P>
<PRE>
        access to *
                by self write
                by anonymous auth
                by * read
</PRE>
<P>This directive allows users to modify their own entries, allows authenticate, and allows all others to read.  Note that only the first <TT>by &lt;who&gt;</TT> clause which matches applies.  Hence, the anonymous users are granted <TT>auth</TT>, not <TT>read</TT>.  The last clause could just as well have been &quot;<TT>by users read</TT>&quot;.</P>
<P>It is often desirable to restrict operations based upon the level of protection in place.  The following shows how security strength factors (SSF) can be used.</P>
<PRE>
        access to *
                by ssf=128 self write
                by ssf=64 anonymous auth
                by ssf=64 users read
</PRE>
<P>This directive allows users to modify their own entries if security protections have of strength 128 or better have been established, allows simple authentication and read access when 64 or better security protections have been established.</P>
<P>The following example shows the use of a regular expression to select the entries by DN in two access directives where ordering is significant.</P>
<PRE>
        access to dn.children=&quot;dc=example,dc=com&quot;
                by * search
        access to dn.children=&quot;dc=com&quot;
                by * read
</PRE>
<P>Read access is granted to entries under the <TT>dc=com</TT> subtree, except for those entries under the <TT>dc=example,dc=com</TT> subtree, to which search access is granted.  No access is granted to <TT>dc=com</TT> as neither access directive matches this DN.  If the order of these access directives was reversed, the trailing directive would never be reached, since all entries under <TT>dc=example,dc=com</TT> are also under <TT>dc=com</TT> entries.</P>
<P>Also note that if no <TT>access to</TT> directive matches or no <TT>by &lt;who&gt;</TT> clause, <B>access is denied</B>.  That is, every <TT>access to</TT> directive ends with an implicit <TT>by * none</TT> clause and every access list ends with an implicit <TT>access to * by * none</TT> directive.</P>
<P>The next example again shows the importance of ordering, both of the access directives and the <TT>by &lt;who&gt;</TT> clauses.  It also shows the use of an attribute selector to grant access to a specific attribute and various <TT>&lt;who&gt;</TT> selectors.</P>
<PRE>
        access to dn.subtree=&quot;dc=example,dc=com&quot; attr=homePhone
                by self write
                by dn.children=dc=example,dc=com&quot; search
                by domain=.*\.example\.com read
        access to dn.subtree=&quot;dc=example,dc=com&quot;
                by self write
                by dn.children=&quot;dc=example,dc=com&quot; search
                by anonymous auth
</PRE>
<P>This example applies to entries in the &quot;<TT>dc=example,dc=com</TT>&quot; subtree. To all attributes except <TT>homePhone</TT>, an entry can write to itself, entries under <TT>example.com</TT> entries can search by them, anybody else has no access (implicit <TT>by * none</TT>) excepting for authentication/authorization (which is always done anonymously).  The <TT>homePhone</TT> attribute is writable by the entry, searchable by entries under <TT>example.com</TT>, readable by clients connecting from somewhere in the <TT>example.com</TT> domain, and otherwise not readable (implicit <TT>by * none</TT>).  All other access is denied by the implicit <TT>access to * by * none</TT>.</P>
<P>Sometimes it is useful to permit a particular DN to add or remove itself from an attribute. For example, if you would like to create a group and allow people to add and remove only their own DN from the member attribute, you could accomplish it with an access directive like this:</P>
<PRE>
        access to attr=member,entry
                by dnattr=member selfwrite
</PRE>
<P>The dnattr <TT>&lt;who&gt;</TT> selector says that the access applies to entries listed in the <TT>member</TT> attribute. The <TT>selfwrite</TT> access selector says that such members can only add or delete their own DN from the attribute, not other values. The addition of the entry attribute is required because access to the entry is required to access any of the entry's attributes.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Configuration File Example">5.4. Configuration File Example</A></H2>
<P>The following is an example configuration file, interspersed with explanatory text. It defines two databases to handle different parts of the <TERM>X.500</TERM> tree; both are <TERM>BDB</TERM> database instances. The line numbers shown are provided for reference only and are not included in the actual file. First, the global configuration section:</P>
<PRE>
  1.    # example config file - global configuration section
  2.    include /usr/local/etc/schema/core.schema
  3.    referral ldap://root.openldap.org
  4.    access to * by * read
</PRE>
<P>Line 1 is a comment. Line 2 includes another config file which contains <EM>core</EM> schema definitions. The <TT>referral</TT> directive on line 3 means that queries not local to one of the databases defined below will be referred to the LDAP server running on the standard port (389) at the host <TT>root.openldap.org</TT>.</P>
<P>Line 4 is a global access control.  It applies to all entries (after any applicable database-specific access controls).</P>
<P>The next section of the configuration file defines a BDB backend that will handle queries for things in the &quot;dc=example,dc=com&quot; portion of the tree. The database is to be replicated to two slave slapds, one on truelies, the other on judgmentday. Indices are to be maintained for several attributes, and the <TT>userPassword</TT> attribute is to be protected from unauthorized access.</P>
<PRE>
  5.    # BDB definition for the example.com
  6.    database bdb
  7.    suffix &quot;dc=example,dc=com&quot;

  9.    rootdn &quot;cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com&quot;
 10.    rootpw secret

 30.            by self write
 31.            by dn.base=&quot;cn=Admin,dc=example,dc=com&quot; write
 32.            by * read
</PRE>
<P>Line 5 is a comment. The start of the database definition is marked by the database keyword on line 6. Line 7 specifies the DN suffix for queries to pass to this database. Line 8 specifies the directory in which the database files will live.</P>
<P>Lines 9 and 10 identify the database <EM>super-user</EM> entry and associated password. This entry is not subject to access control or size or time limit restrictions.</P>
<P>Lines 11 through 18 are for replication. Line 12 specifies the replication log file (where changes to the database are logged - this file is written by slapd and read by slurpd). Lines 13 through 15 specify the hostname and port for a replicated host, the DN to bind as when performing updates, the bind method (simple) and the credentials (password) for the binddn. Lines 16 through 18 specify a second replication site.  See the <A HREF="#Replication with slurpd">Replication with slurpd</A> chapter for more information on these directives.</P>
<P>Lines 20 through 22 indicate the indices to maintain for various attributes.</P>
<P>Lines 24 through 32 specify access control for entries in this database.  As this is the first database, the controls also apply to entries not held in any database (such as the Root DSE).  For all applicable entries, the <TT>userPassword</TT> attribute is writable by the entry itself and by the &quot;admin&quot; entry.  It may be used for authentication/authorization purposes, but is otherwise not readable. All other attributes are writable by the entry and the &quot;admin&quot; entry, but may be read by all users (authenticated or not).</P>
<P>The next section of the example configuration file defines another BDB database. This one handles queries involving the <TT>dc=example,dc=net</TT> subtree but is managed by the same entity as the first database.  Note that without line 39, the read access would be allowed due to the global access rule at line 4.</P>

<P>You may enable multiple levels by specifying the debug option once for each desired level.  Or, since debugging levels are additive, you can do the math yourself. That is, if you want to trace function calls and watch the config file being processed, you could set level to the sum of those two levels (in this case, <TT> -d 65</TT>).  Or, you can let slapd do the math, (e.g. <TT> -d 1 -d 64</TT>).  Consult <TT>&lt;ldap_log.h&gt;</TT> for more details.</P>

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="Database Creation and Maintenance Tools">7. Database Creation and Maintenance Tools</A></H1>
<P>This section tells you how to create a slapd database from scratch, and how to do trouble shooting if you run into problems. There are two ways to create a database. First, you can create the database on-line using LDAP. With this method, you simply start up slapd and add entries using the LDAP client of your choice. This method is fine for relatively small databases (a few hundred or thousand entries, depending on your requirements). This method works for database types which support updates.</P>
<P>The second method of database creation is to do it off-line using special utilities provided with slapd. This method is best if you have many thousands of entries to create, which would take an unacceptably long time using the LDAP method, or if you want to ensure the database is not accessed while it is being created. Note that not all database types support these utilitites.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Creating a database over LDAP">7.1. Creating a database over LDAP</A></H2>
<P>With this method, you use the LDAP client of your choice (e.g., the <EM>ldapadd</EM>(1)) to add entries, just like you would once the database is created.  You should be sure to set the following options in the configuration file before starting <EM>slapd</EM>(8).</P>
<PRE>
        suffix &lt;dn&gt;
</PRE>
<P>As described in the <A HREF="#General Database Directives">General Database Directives</A> section, this option defines which entries are to be held by this database. You should set this to the DN of the root of the subtree you are trying to create.  For example:</P>
<PRE>
        suffix &quot;dc=example,dc=com&quot;
</PRE>
<P>You should be sure to specify a directory where the index files should be created:</P>
<PRE>
        directory &lt;directory&gt;
</PRE>
<P>For example:</P>
<PRE>
        directory /usr/local/var/openldap-data
</PRE>
<P>You need to create this directory with appropriate permissions such that slapd can write to it.</P>
<P>You need to configure slapd so that you can connect to it as a directory user with permission to add entries. You can configure the directory to support a special <EM>super-user</EM> or <EM>root</EM> user just for this purpose. This is done through the following two options in the database definition:</P>
<PRE>
        rootdn &lt;dn&gt;
        rootpw &lt;passwd&gt;
</PRE>
<P>For example:</P>
<PRE>
        rootdn &quot;cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com&quot;
        rootpw secret
</PRE>
<P>These options specify a DN and password that can be used to authenticate as the <EM>super-user</EM> entry of the database (i.e., the entry allowed to do anything). The DN and password specified here will always work, regardless of whether the entry named actually exists or has the password given. This solves the chicken-and-egg problem of how to authenticate and add entries before any entries yet exist.</P>
<P>Finally, you should make sure that the database definition contains the index definitions you want:</P>
<PRE>
        index {&lt;attrlist&gt; | default} [pres,eq,approx,sub,none]
</PRE>
<P>For example, to index the <TT>cn</TT>, <TT>sn</TT>, <TT>uid</TT> and <TT>objectclass</TT> attributes, the following <TT>index</TT> directives could be used:</P>
<PRE>
        index cn,sn,uid pres,eq,approx,sub
        index objectClass eq
</PRE>
<P>This would create presence, equality, approximate, and substring indices for the <TT>cn</TT>, <TT>sn</TT>, and <TT>uid</TT> attributes and an equality index for the <TT>objectClass</TT> attribute.  Note that not all index types are available with all attribute types.  See <A HREF="#The slapd Configuration File">The slapd Configuration File</A> section for more information on this option.</P>
<P>Once you have configured things to your liking, start up slapd, connect with your LDAP client, and start adding entries.  For example, to add an organization entry and an organizational role entry using the <I>ldapadd</I> tool, you could create an <TERM>LDIF</TERM> file called <TT>entries.ldif</TT> with the contents:</P>
<PRE>
        # Organization for Example Corporation
        dn: dc=example,dc=com
        objectClass: dcObject
        objectClass: organization
        dc: example
        o: Example Corporation
        description: The Example Corporation

        # Organizational Role for Directory Manager
        dn: cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com
        objectClass: organizationalRole
        cn: Manager
        description: Directory Manager
</PRE>
<P>and then use a command like this to actually create the entry:</P>
<PRE>
        ldapadd -f entries.ldif -x -D &quot;cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com&quot; -w secret
</PRE>
<P>The above command assumes settings provided in the above examples.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Creating a database off-line">7.2. Creating a database off-line</A></H2>
<P>The second method of database creation is to do it off-line, using the slapd database tools described below. This method is best if you have many thousands of entries to create, which would take an unacceptably long time to add using the LDAP method described above. These tools read the slapd configuration file and an input file containing a text representation of the entries to add. For database types which support the tools, they produce the database files directly (otherwise you must use the on-line method above). There are several important configuration options you will want to be sure and set in the config file database definition first:</P>
<PRE>
        suffix &lt;dn&gt;
</PRE>
<P>As described in the <A HREF="#General Database Directives">General Database Directives</A> section, this option defines which entries are to be held by this database. You should set this to the DN of the root of the subtree you are trying to create.  For example:</P>
<PRE>
        suffix &quot;dc=example,dc=com&quot;
</PRE>
<P>You should be sure to specify a directory where the index files should be created:</P>
<PRE>
        directory &lt;directory&gt;
</PRE>
<P>For example:</P>
<PRE>
        directory /usr/local/var/openldap-data
</PRE>
<P>Finally, you need to specify which indices you want to build.  This is done by one or more index options.</P>
<PRE>
        index {&lt;attrlist&gt; | default} [pres,eq,approx,sub,none]
</PRE>
<P>For example:</P>
<PRE>
        index cn,sn,uid pres,eq,approx,sub
        index objectClass eq
</PRE>
<P>This would create presence, equality, approximate, and substring indices for the <TT>cn</TT>, <TT>sn</TT>, and <TT>uid</TT> attributes and an equality index for the <TT>objectClass</TT> attribute.  Note that not all index types are available with all attribute types.  See <A HREF="#The slapd Configuration File">The slapd Configuration File</A> section for more information on this option.</P>
<H3><A NAME="The {{EX:slapadd}} program">7.2.1. The <TT>slapadd</TT> program</A></H3>
<P>Once you've configured things to your liking, you create the primary database and associated indices by running the <EM>slapadd</EM>(8) program:</P>
<PRE>
        slapadd -l &lt;inputfile&gt; -f &lt;slapdconfigfile&gt;
                [-d &lt;debuglevel&gt;] [-n &lt;integer&gt;|-b &lt;suffix&gt;]
</PRE>
<P>The arguments have the following meanings:</P>
<PRE>
        -l &lt;inputfile&gt;
</PRE>
<P>Specifies the <TERM>LDIF</TERM> input file containing the entries to add in text form (described below in the <A HREF="#The LDIF text entry format">The LDIF text entry format</A> section).</P>
<PRE>
        -f &lt;slapdconfigfile&gt;
</PRE>
<P>Specifies the slapd configuration file that tells where to create the indices, what indices to create, etc.</P>
<PRE>
        -d &lt;debuglevel&gt;
</PRE>
<P>Turn on debugging, as specified by <TT>&lt;debuglevel&gt;</TT>. The debug levels are the same as for slapd.  See the <A HREF="#Command-Line Options">Command-Line Options</A> section in <A HREF="#Running slapd">Running slapd</A>.</P>
<PRE>
        -n &lt;databasenumber&gt;
</PRE>
<P>An optional argument that specifies which database to modify.  The first database listed in the configuration file is <TT>1</TT>, the second <TT>2</TT>, etc. By default, the first database in the configuration file is used. Should not be used in conjunction with <TT>-b</TT>.</P>
<PRE>
        -b &lt;suffix&gt;
</PRE>
<P>An optional argument that specifies which database to modify.  The provided suffix is matched against a database <TT>suffix</TT> directive to determine the database number. Should not be used in conjunction with <TT>-n</TT>.</P>
<H3><A NAME="The {{EX:slapindex}} program">7.2.2. The <TT>slapindex</TT> program</A></H3>
<P>Sometimes it may be necessary to regenerate indices (such as after modifying <EM>slapd.conf</EM>(5)). This is possible using the <EM>slapindex</EM>(8) program.  <EM>slapindex</EM> is invoked like this</P>
<PRE>
        slapindex -f &lt;slapdconfigfile&gt;
                [-d &lt;debuglevel&gt;] [-n &lt;databasenumber&gt;|-b &lt;suffix&gt;]
</PRE>
<P>Where the <TT>-f</TT>, <TT>-d</TT>, <TT>-n</TT> and <TT>-b</TT> options are the same as for the <EM>slapadd</EM>(1) program.  <EM>slapindex</EM> rebuilds all indices based upon the current database contents.</P>
<H3><A NAME="The {{EX:slapcat}} program">7.2.3. The <TT>slapcat</TT> program</A></H3>
<P>The <TT>slapcat</TT> program is used to dump the database to an <TERM>LDIF</TERM> file.  This can be useful when you want to make a human-readable backup of your database or when you want to edit your database off-line.  The program is invoked like this:</P>
<PRE>
        slapcat -l &lt;filename&gt; -f &lt;slapdconfigfile&gt;
                [-d &lt;debuglevel&gt;] [-n &lt;databasenumber&gt;|-b &lt;suffix&gt;]
</PRE>
<P>where <TT>-n</TT> or <TT>-b</TT> is used to select the database in the <EM>slapd.conf</EM>(5) specified using <TT>-f</TT>.  The corresponding <TERM>LDIF</TERM> output is written to standard output or to the file specified using the <TT>-l</TT> option.</P>
<H2><A NAME="The LDIF text entry format">7.3. The LDIF text entry format</A></H2>
<P>The <TERM>LDAP Data Interchange Format</TERM> (LDIF) is used to represent LDAP entries in a simple text format.  This section provides a brief description of the LDIF entry format which complements <EM>ldif</EM>(5) and the technical specification <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2849.txt">RFC2849</A>.</P>
<P>The basic form of an entry is:</P>
<PRE>
        # comment
        dn: &lt;distinguished name&gt;
        &lt;attrdesc&gt;: &lt;attrvalue&gt;
        &lt;attrdesc&gt;: &lt;attrvalue&gt;

        ...
</PRE>
<P>Lines starting with a '<TT>#</TT>' character are comments.  An attribute description may be a simple attribute type like <TT>cn</TT> or <TT>objectClass</TT> or <TT>1.2.3</TT> (an <TERM>OID</TERM> associated with an attribute type) or may include options such as <TT>cn;lang_en_US</TT> or <TT>userCertificate;binary</TT>.</P>
<P>A line may be continued by starting the next line with a <EM>single</EM> space or tab character.  For example:</P>
<PRE>
        dn: cn=Barbara J Jensen,dc=example,dc=
         com
        cn: Barbara J
          Jensen
</PRE>
<P>is equivalent to:</P>
<PRE>
        dn: cn=Barbara J Jensen,dc=example,dc=com
        cn: Barbara J Jensen
</PRE>
<P>Multiple attribute values are specified on separate lines. e.g.,</P>
<PRE>
        cn: Barbara J Jensen
        cn: Babs Jensen
</PRE>
<P>If an <TT>&lt;attrvalue&gt;</TT> contains non-printing characters or begins with a space, a colon ('<TT>:</TT>'), or a less than ('<TT>&lt;</TT>'), the <TT>&lt;attrdesc&gt;</TT> is followed by a double colon and the base64 encoding of the value.  For example, the value &quot;<TT> begins with a space</TT>&quot; would be encoded like this:</P>
<PRE>
        cn:: IGJlZ2lucyB3aXRoIGEgc3BhY2U=
</PRE>
<P>You can also specify a <TERM>URL</TERM> containing the attribute value. For example, the following specifies the <TT>jpegPhoto</TT> value should be obtained from the file <TT>/path/to/file.jpeg</TT>.</P>
<PRE>
        cn:&lt; file:///path/to/file.jpeg
</PRE>
<P>Multiple entries within the same LDIF file are separated by blank lines. Here's an example of an LDIF file containing three entries.</P>
<PRE>
        # Barbara's Entry
        dn: cn=Barbara J Jensen,dc=example,dc=com

<H2><A NAME="Extending Schema">8.2. Extending Schema</A></H2>
<P>Schema used by <EM>slapd</EM>(8) may be extended to support additional syntaxes, matching rules, attribute types, and object classes.  This chapter details how to add user application attribute types and object classes using the syntaxes and matching rules already supported by slapd.  slapd can also be extended to support additional syntaxes, matching rules and system schema, but this requires some programming and hence is not discussed here.</P>
<P>There are five steps to defining new schema:</P>
<OL>
<LI>obtain Object Identifer
<LI>choose a name prefix
<LI>create local schema file
<LI>define custom attribute types (if necessary)
<LI>define custom object classes</OL>
<H3><A NAME="Object Identifiers">8.2.1. Object Identifiers</A></H3>
<P>Each schema element is identified by a globally unique <TERM>Object Identifier</TERM> (OID).  OIDs are also used to identify other objects. They are commonly found in protocols described by <TERM>ASN.1</TERM>.  In particular, they are heavily used by the <TERM>Simple Network Management Protocol</TERM> (SNMP). As OIDs are hierarchical, your organization can obtain one OID and branch it as needed.  For example, if your organization were assigned OID <TT>1.1</TT>, you could branch the tree as follows:</P>

<P>You are, of course, free to design a hierarchy suitable to your organizational needs under your organization's OID.  No matter what hierarchy you choose, you should maintain a registry of assignments you make.  This can be a simple flat file or something more sophisticated such as the <EM>OpenLDAP OID Registry</EM> (<A HREF="http://www.openldap.org/faq/index.cgi?file=197">http://www.openldap.org/faq/index.cgi?file=197</A>).</P>

<UL>
<EM>Under no circumstances should you hijack OID namespace!</EM></UL>
<P>To obtain a registered OID at <EM>no cost</EM>, apply for an OID under the <A HREF="http://www.iana.org/">Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</A> (IANA) maintained <EM>Private Enterprise</EM> arc.  Any private enterprise (organization) may request an OID to be assigned under this arc.  Just fill out the <A HREF="http://www.iana.org/">IANA</A> form at <A HREF="http://www.iana.org/cgi-bin/enterprise.pl">http://www.iana.org/cgi-bin/enterprise.pl</A> and your official OID will be sent to you usually within a few days.  Your base OID will be something like <TT>1.3.6.1.4.1.X</TT> where <TT>X</TT> is an integer.</P>
<P><HR WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="Left">
<STRONG>Note: </STRONG>Don't let the &quot;MIB/SNMP&quot; statement on the IANA page confuse you.  OIDs obtained using this form may be used for any purpose including identifying LDAP schema elements.
<HR WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="Left"></P>
<P>Alternatively, OID name space may be available from a national authority (e.g., ANSI, BSI).</P>

<H3><A NAME="Name Prefix">8.2.2. Name Prefix</A></H3>
<P>In addition to assigning a unique object identifier to each schema element, you should provide a least one textual name for each element.  The name should be both descriptive and not likely to clash with names of other schema elements.  In particular, any name you choose should not clash with present or future Standard Track names.</P>
<P>To reduce (but not eliminate) the potential for name clashes, the convention is to prefix names of non-Standard Track with a few letters to localize the changes to your organization.  The smaller the organization, the longer your prefix should be.</P>
<P>In the examples below, we have chosen a short prefix '<TT>my</TT>' (to save space).  Such a short prefix would only be suitable for a very large, global organization.  In general, we recommend something like '<TT>deFirm</TT>' (German company) or '<TT>comExample</TT>' (elements associated with organization associated with <TT>example.com</TT>).</P>
<H3><A NAME="Local schema file">8.2.3. Local schema file</A></H3>
<P>The <TT>objectclass</TT> and <TT>attributeTypes</TT> configuration file directives can be used to define schema rules on entries in the directory.  It is customary to create a file to contain definitions of your custom schema items.  We recommend you create a file <TT>local.schema</TT> in <TT>/usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/local.schema</TT> and then include this file in your <EM>slapd.conf</EM>(5) file immediately after other schema <TT>include</TT> directives.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Attribute Type Specification">8.2.4. Attribute Type Specification</A></H3>
<P>The <EM>attributetype</EM> directive is used to define a new attribute type.  The directive uses the same Attribute Type Description (as defined in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2252.txt">RFC2252</A>) used by the attributeTypes attribute found in the subschema subentry, e.g.:</P>
<PRE>
        attributetype &lt;<A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2252.txt">RFC2252</A> Attribute Type Description&gt;
</PRE>
<P>where Attribute Type Description is defined by the following <TERM>BNF</TERM>:</P>
<PRE>
      AttributeTypeDescription = &quot;(&quot; whsp
            numericoid whsp              ; AttributeType identifier
          [ &quot;NAME&quot; qdescrs ]             ; name used in AttributeType

          [ &quot;NO-USER-MODIFICATION&quot; whsp ]; default user modifiable
          [ &quot;USAGE&quot; whsp AttributeUsage ]; default userApplications
          whsp &quot;)&quot;

      AttributeUsage =

          &quot;distributedOperation&quot; / ; DSA-shared
          &quot;dSAOperation&quot;          ; DSA-specific, value depends on server

</PRE>
<P>where whsp is a space ('<TT> </TT>'), numericoid is a globally unique OID in dotted-decimal form (e.g. <TT>1.1.0</TT>), qdescrs is one or more names, woid is either the name or OID optionally followed by a length specifier (e.g <TT>{10</TT>}).</P>
<P>For example, the attribute types <TT>name</TT> and <TT>cn</TT> are defined in <TT>core.schema</TT> as:</P>
<PRE>
        attributeType ( 2.5.4.41 NAME 'name'
                DESC 'name(s) associated with the object'
                EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
                SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
                SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15{32768} )
        attributeType ( 2.5.4.3 NAME ( 'cn' 'commonName' )
                DESC 'common name(s) assciated with the object'
                SUP name )
</PRE>
<P>Notice that each defines the attribute's OID, provides a short name, and a brief description.  Each name is an alias for the OID. <EM>slapd</EM>(8) returns the first listed name when returning results.</P>
<P>The first attribute, <TT>name</TT>, holds values of <TT>directoryString</TT> (UTF-8 encoded Unicode) syntax.  The syntax is specified by OID (1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 identifies the directoryString syntax).  A length recommendation of 32768 is specified.  Servers should support values of this length, but may support longer values The field does NOT specify a size constraint, so is ignored on servers (such as slapd) which don't impose such size limits.  In addition, the equality and substring matching uses case ignore rules.  Below are tables listing commonly used syntax and matching rules (OpenLDAP supports these and many more).</P>

<P>The second attribute, <TT>cn</TT>, is a subtype of <TT>name</TT> hence it inherits the syntax, matching rules, and usage of <TT>name</TT>. <TT>commonName</TT> is an alternative name.</P>
<P>Neither attribute is restricted to a single value.  Both are meant for usage by user applications.  Neither is obsolete nor collective.</P>
<P>The following subsections provide a couple of examples.</P>
<H4><A NAME="myUniqueName">8.2.4.1. myUniqueName</A></H4>
<P>Many organizations maintain a single unique name for each user. Though one could use <TT>displayName</TT> (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2798.txt">RFC2798</A>), this attribute is really meant to be controlled by the user, not the organization.  We could just copy the definition of <TT>displayName</TT> from <TT>inetorgperson.schema</TT> and replace the OID, name, and description, e.g:</P>
<PRE>
        attributetype ( 1.1.2.1.1 NAME 'myUniqueName'
                DESC 'unique name with my organization'
                EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
                SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
                SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15
                SINGLE-VALUE )
</PRE>
<P>However, if we want this name to be included in <TT>name</TT> assertions [e.g. <TT>(name=*Jane*)</TT>], the attribute could alternatively be defined as a subtype of <TT>name</TT>, e.g.:</P>
<PRE>
        attributetype ( 1.1.2.1.1 NAME 'myUniqueName'
                DESC 'unique name with my organization'
                SUP name )
</PRE>
<H4><A NAME="myPhoto">8.2.4.2. myPhoto</A></H4>
<P>Many organizations maintain a photo of each each user.  A <TT>myPhoto</TT> attribute type could be defined to hold a photo. Of course, one could use just use <TT>jpegPhoto</TT> (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2798.txt">RFC2798</A>) (or a subtype) to hold the photo.  However, you can only do this if the photo is in <EM>JPEG File Interchange Format</EM>. Alternatively, an attribute type which uses the <EM>Octet String</EM> syntax can be defined, e.g.:</P>
<PRE>
        attributetype ( 1.1.2.1.2 NAME 'myPhoto'
                DESC 'a photo (application defined format)'
                SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40
                SINGLE-VALUE )
</PRE>
<P>In this case, the syntax doesn't specify the format of the photo. It's assumed (maybe incorrectly) that all applications accessing this attribute agree on the handling of values.</P>
<P>If you wanted to support multiple photo formats, you could define a separate attribute type for each format, prefix the photo with some typing information, or describe the value using <TERM>ASN.1</TERM> and use the <TT>;binary</TT> transfer option.</P>
<P>Another alternative is for the attribute to hold a <TERM>URI</TERM> pointing to the photo.  You can model such an attribute after <TT>labeledURI</TT> (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2079.txt">RFC2079</A>) or simply create a subtype, e.g.:</P>
<PRE>
        attributetype ( 1.1.2.1.3 NAME 'myPhotoURI'
                DESC 'URI and optional label referring to a photo'
                SUP labeledURI )
</PRE>
<H3><A NAME="Object Class Specification">8.2.5. Object Class Specification</A></H3>
<P>The <EM>objectclasses</EM> directive is used to define a new object class.  The directive uses the same Object Class Description (as defined in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2252.txt">RFC2252</A>) used by the objectClasses attribute found in the subschema subentry, e.g.:</P>
<PRE>
        objectclass &lt;<A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2252.txt">RFC2252</A> Object Class Description&gt;

</PRE>
<P>where whsp is a space ('<TT> </TT>'), numericoid is a globally unique OID in numeric form (e.g. <TT>1.1.0</TT>), qdescrs is one or more names, and oids is one or more names and/or OIDs.</P>

                MAY myPhoto )
</PRE>
<H4><A NAME="myPerson">8.2.5.2. myPerson</A></H4>
<P>If your organization would like have a private <EM>structural</EM> object class to instantiate users, you can subclass one of the existing person classes, such as <TT>inetOrgPerson</TT> (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2798.txt">RFC2798</A>), and add any additional attributes which you desire.</P>
<PRE>
        objectclass ( 1.1.2.2.2 NAME 'myPerson'
                DESC 'my person'

                MUST ( myUniqueName $ givenName )
                MAY myPhoto )
</PRE>
<P>The object class inherits the required/allowed attribute types of <TT>inetOrgPerson</TT> but requires <TT>myUniqueName</TT> and <TT>givenName</TT> and allows <TT>myPhoto</TT>.</P>
<H3><A NAME="OID Macros">8.2.6. OID Macros</A></H3>
<P>To ease the management and use of OIDs, <EM>slapd</EM>(8) supports <EM>Object Identifier</EM> macros.  The <TT>objectIdentifier</TT> directive is used to equate a macro (name) with a OID.  The OID may possibly be derived from a previously defined OID macro.   The <EM>slapd.conf</EM>(5) syntax is:</P>
<PRE>
        objectIdentifier &lt;name&gt; { &lt;oid&gt; | &lt;name&gt;[:&lt;suffix&gt;] }

<H1><A NAME="Security Considerations">9. Security Considerations</A></H1>
<P>OpenLDAP Software is designed to run in a wide variety of computing environments from tightly-controlled closed networks to the global Internet.  Hence, OpenLDAP Software provides many different security mechanisms.  This chapter describes these mechanisms and discusses security considerations for using OpenLDAP Software.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Network Security">9.1. Network Security</A></H2>
<H3><A NAME="Selective Listening">9.1.1. Selective Listening</A></H3>
<P>By default, <EM>slapd</EM>(8) will listen on both the IPv4 and IPv6 &quot;any&quot; addresses.  It is often desirable to have <EM>slapd</EM> listen on select address/port pairs.  For example, listening only on the IPv4 address <TT>127.0.0.1</TT> will disallow remote access to the directory server. E.g.:</P>
<PRE>
        slapd -h ldap://127.0.0.1
</PRE>
<P>While the server can be configured to listen on a particular interface address, this doesn't necessarily restrict access to the server to only those networks accessible via that interface.   To selective restrict remote access, it is recommend that an <A HREF="#IP Firewall">IP Firewall</A> be used to restrict access.</P>
<P>See <A HREF="#Command-line Options">Command-line Options</A> and <EM>slapd</EM>(8) for more information.</P>
<H3><A NAME="IP Firewall">9.1.2. IP Firewall</A></H3>
<P><TERM>IP</TERM> firewall capabilities of the server system can be used to restrict access based upon the client's IP address and/or network interface used to communicate with the client.</P>
<P>Generally, <EM>slapd</EM>(8) listens on port 389/tcp for LDAP over <TERM>TCP</TERM> (e.g.  <A HREF="ldap://">ldap://</A>) and port 636/tcp for LDAP over <TERM>SSL</TERM> (e.g.  <A HREF="ldaps://">ldaps://</A>).  Note that LDAP over TCP sessions can be protected by <TERM>TLS</TERM> through the use of <EM>StartTLS</EM>.  StartTLS is the Standard Track mechanism for protecting LDAP sessions with TLS.</P>
<P>As specifics of how to configure IP firewall are dependent on the particular kind of IP firewall used, no examples are provided here. See the document associated with your IP firewall.</P>
<H3><A NAME="TCP Wrappers">9.1.3. TCP Wrappers</A></H3>
<P>OpenLDAP supports <TERM>TCP</TERM> Wrappers.  TCP Wrappers provide a rule-based access control system for controlling TCP/IP access to the server. For example, the <EM>host_options</EM>(5) rule:</P>
<PRE>
        slapd: 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 127.0.0.1 : ALLOW
        slapd: ALL : DENY
</PRE>
<P>allows only incoming connections from the private network <TT>10.0.0.0</TT> and localhost (<TT>127.0.0.1</TT>) to access the directory service. Note that IP addresses are used as <EM>slapd</EM>(8) is not normally configured to perform reverse lookups.</P>
<P>It is noted that TCP wrappers require the connection to be accepted. As significant processing is required just to deny a connection, it is generally advised that IP firewall protection be used instead of TCP wrappers.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Integrity and Confidentiality Protection">9.2. Integrity and Confidentiality Protection</A></H2>
<P><TERM>Transport Layer Security</TERM> (TLS) can be used to provide integrity and confidentiality protection.  OpenLDAP supports both StartTLS and <A HREF="ldaps://">ldaps://</A>.  See the <A HREF="#Using TLS">Using TLS</A> chapter for more information.</P>
<P>A number of <TERM>Simple Authentication and Security Layer</TERM> (SASL) mechanisms, such as DIGEST-MD5 and <TERM>GSSAPI</TERM>, also provide integrity and confidentiality protection.  See the <A HREF="#Using SASL">Using SASL</A> chapter for more information.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Security Strength Factors">9.2.1. Security Strength Factors</A></H3>
<P>The server uses <TERM>Security Strength Factor</TERM>s (SSF) to indicate the relative strength of protection.  A SSF of zero (0) indicates no protections are in place.  A SSF of one (1) indicates integrity protection are in place.  A SSF greater than one (&gt;1) roughly correlates to the effective encryption key length.  For example, <TERM>DES</TERM> is 56, <TERM>3DES</TERM> is 112, and <TERM>AES</TERM> 128, 192, or 256.</P>
<P>A number of administrative controls rely on SSFs associated with TLS and SASL protection in place on an LDAP session.</P>
<P><TT>security</TT> controls disallow operations when appropriate protections are not in place.  For example:</P>
<PRE>
        security ssf=1 update_ssf=112
</PRE>
<P>requires integrity protection for all operations and encryption protection, 3DES equivalent, for update operations (e.g. add, delete, modify, etc.).  See <EM>slapd.conf</EM>(5) for details.</P>
<P>For fine-grained control, SSFs may be used in access controls.  See <A HREF="#Access Control">Access Control</A> section of the <A HREF="#The slapd Configuration File">The slapd Configuration File</A> for more information.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Authentication Methods">9.3. Authentication Methods</A></H2>
<H3><A NAME="&quot;simple&quot; method">9.3.1. &quot;simple&quot; method</A></H3>
<P>The LDAP &quot;simple&quot; method has three modes of operation:</P>
<UL>
<LI>anonymous,
<LI>unauthenticated, and
<LI>user/password authenticated.</UL>
<P>Anonymous access is obtained by providing no name and no password to the &quot;simple&quot; bind operation.  Unauthenticated access is obtained by providing a name but no password.  Authenticated access is obtain by providing a valid name and password.</P>
<P>An anonymous bind results in an <EM>anonymous</EM> authorization. Anonymous bind mechanism is enabled by default, but can be disabled by specifying &quot;<TT>disallow bind_anon</TT>&quot; in <EM>slapd.conf</EM>(5).</P>
<P>An unauthenticated bind results in an <EM>anonymous</EM> authorization. Unauthenticated bind mechanism is disabled by default, but can be enabled by specifying &quot;<TT>allow bind_anon_cred</TT>&quot; in <EM>slapd.conf</EM>(5). As a number of LDAP applications mistakenly generate unauthenticated bind request when authenticated access was intended (that is, they do not ensure a password was provided), this mechanism should generally not be enabled.</P>
<P>A successful user/password authenticated bind results in a user authorization identity, the provided name, being associated with the session.  User/password authenticated bind is enabled by default. However, as this mechanism offers no evesdropping protection (e.g., the password is set in the clear), it is recommended that it be used only in tightly controlled systems or when the LDAP session is protected by other means (e.g., TLS, <TERM>IPSEC</TERM>).  Where the administrator relies on TLS to protect the password, it is recommended that unprotected authentication be disabled.  This is done by setting &quot;<TT>disallow bind_simple_unprotected</TT>&quot; in <EM>slapd.conf</EM>(5). The <TT>security</TT> directive's <TT>simple_bind</TT> option provides fine grain control over the level of confidential protection to require for <EM>simple</EM> user/password authentication.</P>
<P>The user/password authenticated bind mechanism can be completely disabled by setting &quot;<TT>disallow bind_simple</TT>&quot;.</P>

<H3><A NAME="SASL method">9.3.2. SASL method</A></H3>
<P>The LDAP SASL method allows use of any SASL authentication mechanism.  The <A HREF="#Using SASL">Using SASL</A> discusses use of SASL.</P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="Using SASL">10. Using SASL</A></H1>
<P>OpenLDAP clients and servers are capable of authenticating via the <TERM>Simple Authentication and Security Layer</TERM> (<TERM>SASL</TERM>) framework, which is detailed in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2222.txt">RFC2222</A>.   This chapter describes how to make use of SASL in OpenLDAP.</P>
<P>There are several industry standard authentication mechanisms that can be used with SASL, including <TERM>Kerberos</TERM> V4, <TERM>GSSAPI</TERM>, and DIGEST-MD.  The standard client tools provided with OpenLDAP, such as <EM>ldapsearch</EM>(1) and <EM>ldapmodify</EM>(1), will by default attempt to authenticate the user to the <EM>slapd</EM>(8) server using SASL. Basic authentication service can be set up by the LDAP administrator with a few steps, allowing users to be authenticated to the slapd server as their LDAP entry.  With a few extra steps, some users and services can be allowed to exploit SASL's proxy authorization feature, allowing them to authenticate themselves and then switch their identity to that of another user or service.</P>
<P>This chapter assumes you have read <EM>Cyrus SASL for System Administrators</EM>, provided with the <A HREF="http://asg.web.cmu.edu/cyrus/">Cyrus</A> <A HREF="http://asg.web.cmu.edu/sasl/sasl-library.html">SASL</A> package (in <TT>doc/sysadmin.html</TT>) and have a working Cyrus SASL installation.  You should use the Cyrus SASL <TT>sample_client</TT> and <TT>sample_server</TT> to test your SASL installation before attempting to make use of it in OpenLDAP.</P>
<P>Note that in the following text the term <EM>user</EM> is used to describe a person or application entity who is connecting to the LDAP server via an LDAP client, such as <EM>ldapsearch</EM>(1).  That is, the term <EM>user</EM> not only applies to both an individual using an LDAP client, but to an application entity which issues LDAP client operations without direct user control.  For example, an e-mail server which uses LDAP operations to access information held in an LDAP server is an application entity.</P>
<H2><A NAME="SASL Security Considerations">10.1. SASL Security Considerations</A></H2>
<P>SASL offers many different authentication mechanisms.  This section briefly outlines security considerations.</P>
<P>Some mechanisms, such as PLAIN and LOGIN, offer no greater security over LDAP &quot;simple&quot; authentication.  Like &quot;simple&quot; authentication, such mechanisms should not be used unless you have adequate security protections in place.  It is recommended that these mechanisms be used only in conjunction with <TERM>Transport Layer Security</TERM> (TLS).  Use of PLAIN and LOGIN are not discussed further in this document.</P>
<P>The DIGEST-MD5 mechanism is the mandatory-to-implement authentication mechanism for LDAPv3.  Though DIGEST-MD5 is not a strong authentication mechanism in comparison with trusted third party authentication systems (such as Kerberos or public key systems), yet it does offer significant protections against a number of attacks.  Unlike the CRAM-MD5 mechanism, it prevents chosen plaintext attacks.  DIGEST-MD5 is favored over the weaker and even more dangerous use of plaintext password mechanisms.  The CRAM-MD5 mechanism is deprecated in favor of DIGEST-MD5.  Use of <A HREF="#DIGEST-MD5">DIGEST-MD5</A> is discussed below.</P>
<P>The KERBEROS_V4 mechanism utilizes Kerberos IV to provide secure authentication services.  There is also a GSSAPI based mechanism which is generally used in conjunction with Kerberos V.  Kerberos is viewed as a secure, distributed authentication system suitable for both small and large enterprises.  Use of <A HREF="#KERBEROS_V4">KERBEROS_V4</A> and <A HREF="#GSSAPI">GSSAPI</A> are discussed below.</P>
<P>The EXTERNAL mechanism utilizes authentication services provided by lower level network services such as <TERM>TLS</TERM> (TLS).  When used in conjunction with <TERM>TLS</TERM> <TERM>X.509</TERM>-based public key technology, EXTERNAL offers strong authentication.  Use of EXTERNAL is discussed in the <A HREF="#Using TLS">Using TLS</A> chapter.</P>
<P>There are other strong authentication mechanisms to choose from, including OTP (one time passwords) and SRP (secure remote passwords). These mechanisms are not discussed in this document.</P>
<H2><A NAME="SASL Authentication">10.2. SASL Authentication</A></H2>
<P>Getting basic SASL authentication running involves a few steps. The first step configures your slapd server environment so that it can communicate with client programs using the security system in place at your site. This usually involves setting up a service key, a public key, or other form of secret. The second step concerns mapping authentication identities to LDAP DN's, which depends on how entries are laid out in your directory. An explanation of the first step will be given in the next section using Kerberos V4 as an example mechanism. The steps necessary for your site's authentication mechanism will be similar, but a guide to every mechanism available under SASL is beyond the scope of this chapter. The second step is described in the section <A HREF="#Mapping Authentication identities to LDAP entries">Mapping Authentication identities to LDAP entries</A>.</P>
<H3><A NAME="KERBEROS_V4">10.2.1. KERBEROS_V4</A></H3>
<P>This section describes the use of the SASL KERBEROS_V4 mechanism with OpenLDAP.  It will be assumed that you are familiar with the workings of the Kerberos IV security system, and that your site has Kerberos IV deployed.  Your users should be familiar with authentication policy, how to receive credentials in a Kerberos ticket cache, and how to refresh expired credentials.</P>
<P>Client programs will need to be able to obtain a session key for use when connecting to your LDAP server. This allows the LDAP server to know the identity of the user, and allows the client to know it is connecting to a legitimate server. If encryption layers are to be used, the session key can also be used to help negotiate that option.</P>
<P>The slapd server runs the service called &quot;<EM>ldap</EM>&quot;, and the server will require a srvtab file with a service key.  SASL aware client programs will be obtaining an &quot;ldap&quot; service ticket with the user's ticket granting ticket (TGT), with the instance of the ticket matching the hostname of the OpenLDAP server. For example, if your realm is named <TT>EXAMPLE.COM</TT> and the slapd server is running on the host named <TT>directory.example.com</TT>, the <TT>/etc/srvtab</TT> file on the server will have a service key</P>
<PRE>
        ldap.directory@EXAMPLE.COM
</PRE>
<P>When an LDAP client is authenticating a user to the directory using the KERBEROS_IV mechanism, it will request a session key for that same principal, either from the ticket cache or by obtaining a new one from the Kerberos server.  This will require the TGT to be available and valid in the cache as well.  If it is not present or has expired, SASL will print out the message</P>
<PRE>
        ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: Local error
</PRE>
<P>When the service ticket is obtained, it will be passed to the LDAP server as proof of the user's identity.  The server will extract the identity and realm out of the service ticket using SASL library calls, and convert them into an <EM>authentication request DN</EM> of the form</P>
<PRE>
        uid=&lt;username&gt;,cn=&lt;realm&gt;,cn=&lt;mechanism&gt;,cn=auth
</PRE>
<P>So in our above example, if the user's name were &quot;adamson&quot;, the authentication request DN would be:</P>
<PRE>
        uid=adamsom,cn=example.com,cn=kerberos_v4,cn=auth
</PRE>
<P>This authentication request DN by itself could be placed into ACL's and <TT>groupOfNames</TT> &quot;member&quot; attributes, since it is of legitimate LDAP DN format. The section <A HREF="#Mapping Authentication identities to LDAP entries">Mapping Authentication identities to LDAP entries</A>, however, tells how to map that DN into the DN of a person's own LDAP entry.</P>
<P>Also note that this example, being for Kerberos, shows the &lt;realm&gt; portion of the DN being filled in with the Kerberos realm of the company. Several other authentication mechanisms do not employ the concept of a realm, so the &quot;,cn=&lt;realm&gt;&quot; portion of the authentication request DN would not appear.</P>
<H3><A NAME="GSSAPI">10.2.2. GSSAPI</A></H3>
<P>This section describes the use of the SASL GSSAPI mechanism and Kerberos V with OpenLDAP. Since Kerberos V is being used, the information is very similar to the previous section.  It will be assumed that you have Kerberos V deployed, you are familiar with the operation of the system, and that your users are trained in its use.  This section also assumes you have familiarized yourself with the use of the GSSAPI mechanism by reading <EM>Configuring GSSAPI and Cyrus SASL</EM> (provided with Cyrus SASL in the <TT>doc/gssapi</TT> file) and successfully experimented with the Cyrus provided <TT>sample_server</TT> and <TT>sample_client</TT> applications.  General information about Kerberos is available at <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/">http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/</A>.</P>
<P>To use the GSSAPI mechanism with <EM>slapd</EM>(8) one must create a service key with a principal for <EM>ldap</EM> service within the realm for the host on which the service runs.  For example, if you run <EM>slapd</EM> on <TT>directory.example.com</TT> and your realm is <TT>EXAMPLE.COM</TT>, you need to create a service key with the principal:</P>
<PRE>
        ldap/directory.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
</PRE>
<P>When <EM>slapd</EM>(8) runs, it must have access to this key.  This is generally done by placing the key into a keytab, such as <TT>/etc/krb5.keytab</TT>.</P>
<P>To use the GSSAPI mechanism to authenticate to the directory, the user obtains a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) prior to running the LDAP client.  When using OpenLDAP client tools, the user may mandate use of the GSSAPI mechanism by specifying <TT>-Y GSSAPI</TT> as a command option.</P>
<P>For the purposes of authentication and authorization, <EM>slapd</EM>(8) associates a non-mapped authentication request DN of the form:</P>
<PRE>
        uid=&lt;principal&gt;,cn=&lt;realm&gt;,cn=gssapi,cn=auth
</PRE>
<P>Continuing our example, a user with the Kerberos principal <TT>kurt@EXAMPLE.COM</TT> would have the associated DN:</P>
<PRE>
        uid=kurt,cn=example.com,cn=gssapi,cn=auth
</PRE>
<P>and the principal <TT>ursula@FOREIGN.REALM</TT> would have the associated DN:</P>
<PRE>
        uid=ursula,cn=foreign.realm,cn=gssapi,cn=auth
</PRE>
<H3><A NAME="DIGEST-MD5">10.2.3. DIGEST-MD5</A></H3>
<P>This section describes the use of the SASL DIGEST-MD5 mechanism using secrets stored either in the directory itself or in Cyrus SASL's own database. DIGEST-MD5 relies on the client and the server sharing a &quot;secret&quot;, usually a password. The server generates a challenge and the client a response proving that it knows the shared secret. This is much more secure than simply sending the secret over the wire.</P>
<P>Cyrus SASL supports several shared-secret mechanisms. To do this, it needs access to the plaintext password (unlike mechanisms which pass plaintext passwords over the wire, where the server can store a hashed version of the password).</P>
<P>Secret passwords are normally stored in Cyrus SASL's own <EM>sasldb</EM> database, but if OpenLDAP has been compiled with Cyrus SASL 2.1 it is possible to store the secrets in the LDAP database itself. With Cyrus SASL 1.5, secrets may only be stored in the <EM>sasldb</EM>.  In either case it is very important to apply file access controls and LDAP access controls to prevent exposure of the passwords.</P>
<P>The configuration and commands discussed in this section assume the use of Cyrus SASL 2.1. If you are using version 1.5 then certain features will not be available, and the command names will not have the trailing digit &quot;2&quot;.</P>
<P>To use secrets stored in <EM>sasldb</EM>, simply add users with the <EM>saslpasswd2</EM> command:</P>
<PRE>
       saslpasswd2 -c &lt;username&gt;
</PRE>
<P>The passwords for such users must be managed with the <EM>saslpasswd2</EM> command.</P>
<P>To use secrets stored in the LDAP directory, place plaintext passwords in the <TT>userPassword</TT> attribute. It will be necessary to add an option to <TT>slapd.conf</TT> to make sure that passwords changed through LDAP are stored in plaintext:</P>
<PRE>
       password-hash   {CLEARTEXT}
</PRE>
<P>Passwords stored in this way can be managed either with <TT>ldappasswd</TT> or by simply modifying the <TT>userPassword</TT> attribute.</P>
<P>Wherever the passwords are stored, a mapping will be needed from SASL authentication IDs to regular DNs. The DIGEST-MD5 mechanism produces authentication IDs of the form:</P>
<PRE>
        uid=&lt;username&gt;,cn=&lt;realm&gt;,cn=digest-md5,cn=auth
</PRE>
<P>NOTE that if the default realm is used, the realm name is omitted from the ID, giving:</P>
<PRE>
        uid=&lt;username&gt;,cn=digest-md5,cn=auth
</PRE>
<P>See <A HREF="#Mapping Authentication identities to LDAP entries">Mapping Authentication identities to LDAP entries</A> below for information on mapping such IDs to DNs.</P>
<P>With suitable mappings in place, users can specify SASL IDs when performing LDAP operations, and the password stored in <EM>sasldb</EM> or in the directory itself will be used to verify the authentication. For example, the user identified by the directory entry:</P>
<PRE>
       dn: cn=Andrew Findlay+uid=u000997,dc=example,dc=com
       objectclass: inetOrgPerson
       objectclass: person
       sn: Findlay
       uid: u000997
       userPassword: secret
</PRE>
<P>can issue commands of the form:</P>
<PRE>
       ldapsearch -U u000997 -b dc=example,dc=com 'cn=andrew*'
</PRE>
<P>or can specify the realm explicitly:</P>
<PRE>
       ldapsearch -U u000997@myrealm -b dc=example,dc=com 'cn=andrew*'
</PRE>
<P>If several SASL mechanisms are supported at your site, it may be necessary to specify which one to use, e.g.:</P>
<PRE>
       ldapsearch -Y DIGEST-MD5 -U u000997 -b dc=example,dc=com 'cn=andrew*'
</PRE>
<P><HR WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="Left">
<STRONG>Note: </STRONG>in each of the above cases, no authorization identity (e.g. <TT>-X</TT>) was provided.

<HR WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="Left"></P>
<H3><A NAME="Mapping Authentication identities to LDAP entries">10.2.4. Mapping Authentication identities to LDAP entries</A></H3>
<P>The authentication mechanism in the slapd server will use SASL library calls to obtain the authenticated user's &quot;username&quot;, based on whatever underlying authentication mechanism was used.  This username is in the namespace of the authentication mechanism, and not in the LDAP namespace. As stated in the sections above, that username is reformatted into an authentication request DN of the form</P>
<PRE>
        uid=&lt;username&gt;,cn=&lt;realm&gt;,cn=&lt;mechanism&gt;,cn=auth

<P>depending on whether or not &lt;mechanism&gt; employs the concept of &quot;realms&quot;. Note also that the realm part will be omitted if the default realm was used in the authentication.</P>
<P>It is not intended that you should add LDAP entries of the above form to your LDAP database. Chances are you have an LDAP entry for each of the people that will be authenticating to LDAP, laid out in your directory tree, and the tree does not start at cn=auth. But if your site has a clear mapping between the &quot;username&quot; and an LDAP entry for the person, you will be able to configure your LDAP server to automatically map a authentication request DN to the user's <EM>authentication DN</EM>.</P>
<P><HR WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="Left">
<STRONG>Note: </STRONG>it is not required that the authentication request DN nor the user's authentication DN resulting from the mapping refer to an entry held in the directory.  However, additional capabilities become available (see below).
<HR WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="Left"></P>
<P>The LDAP administrator will need to tell the slapd server how to map an authentication request DN to a user's authentication DN. This is done by adding one or more <TT>sasl-regexp</TT> directives to the <EM>slapd.conf</EM>(5) file.  This directive takes two arguments:</P>
<PRE>
        sasl-regexp   &lt;search pattern&gt;   &lt;replacement pattern&gt;
</PRE>
<P>The authentication request DN is compared to the search pattern using the regular expression functions <EM>regcomp</EM>() and <EM>regexec</EM>(), and if it matches, it is rewritten as the replacement pattern. If there are multiple <TT>sasl-regexp</TT> directives, only the first whose search pattern matches the authentication identity is used. The string that is output from the replacement pattern should be the authentication DN of the user, in a legitimate LDAP DN format. It can also be an LDAP URL, which is discussed below.</P>
<P>The search pattern can contain any of the regular expression characters listed in <EM>regexec</EM>(3C). The main characters of note are dot &quot;.&quot;, asterisk &quot;*&quot;, and the open and close parenthesis &quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot;.  Essentially, the dot matches any character, the asterisk allows zero or more repeats of the immediately preceding character or pattern, and terms in parenthesis are remembered for the replacement pattern.</P>
<P>The replacement pattern will produce the final authentication DN of the user.  Anything from the authentication request DN that matched a string in parenthesis in the search pattern is stored in the variable &quot;$1&quot;. That variable &quot;$1&quot; can appear in the replacement pattern, and will be replaced by the string from the authentication request DN. If there were multiple sets of parentheses in the search pattern, the variables $2, $3, etc are used.</P>
<P>For example, suppose the user's authentication identity is written as the DN string</P>
<PRE>
        uid=adamson,cn=example.com,cn=kerberos_v4,cn=auth
</PRE>
<P>and the user's actual LDAP entry is</P>
<PRE>
        uid=adamson,ou=person,dc=example,dc=com
</PRE>
<P>The <TT>sasl-regexp</TT> directive in <EM>slapd.conf</EM>(5) could be written</P>
<PRE>
        sasl-regexp
          uid=(.*),cn=example.com,cn=kerberos_v4,cn=auth
          uid=$1,ou=person,dc=example,dc=com
</PRE>
<P>An even more lenient rule could be written as</P>
<PRE>
        sasl-regexp
          uid=(.*),cn=.*,cn=auth
          uid=$1,ou=person,dc=example,dc=com
</PRE>
<P>Be careful about setting the search pattern too leniently, however, since it may mistakenly allow people to become authenticated as a DN to which they should not have access. It is better to write several strict directives than one lenient directive which has security holes. If there is only one authentication mechanism in place at your site, and zero or one realms in use, you might be able to map between authentication identities and LDAP DN's with a single <TT>sasl-regexp</TT> directive.</P>
<P>Don't forget to allow for the case where the realm is omitted as well as the case with an explicitly specified realm. This may well require a separate <TT>sasl-regexp</TT> directive for each case, with the explicit-realm entry being listed first.</P>
<P>Some sites may have people's DN's spread to multiple areas of the LDAP tree, such as if there were an <TT>ou=accounting</TT> tree and an <TT>ou=engineering</TT> tree, with people interspersed between them. Or there may not be enough information in the authentication identity to isolate the DN, such as if the above person's LDAP entry looked like</P>
<PRE>
        dn: cn=mark adamson,ou=person,dc=example,dc=com
        objectclass: Person
        cn: mark adamson
        uid: adamson
</PRE>
<P>In this case, the information in the authentication identity can only be used to search for the user's DN, not derive it directly. For both of these situations, and others, the replacement pattern in the <TT>sasl-regexp</TT> directives will need to produce an LDAP URL, described in the next section.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Performing searches for a person\'s DN">10.2.5. Performing searches for a person's DN</A></H3>
<P>When there is not enough information in the authentication identity to derive a person's authentication DN directly, the <TT>sasl-regexp</TT> directives in the <EM>slapd.conf</EM>(5) file will need to produce an LDAP URL.  This URL will then be used to perform an internal search of the LDAP database to find the person's authentication DN.</P>
<P>An LDAP URL, similar to other URL's, is of the form</P>
<PRE>
        ldap://&lt;host&gt;/&lt;base&gt;?&lt;attrs&gt;?&lt;scope&gt;?&lt;filter&gt;
</PRE>
<P>This contains all of the elements necessary to perform an LDAP search:  the name of the server &lt;host&gt;, the LDAP DN search base &lt;base&gt;, the LDAP attributes to retrieve &lt;attrs&gt;, the search scope &lt;scope&gt; which is one of the three options &quot;base&quot;, &quot;one&quot;, or &quot;sub&quot;, and lastly an LDAP search filter &lt;filter&gt;.  Since the search is for an LDAP DN within the current server, the &lt;host&gt; portion should be empty.  The &lt;attrs&gt; field is also ignored since only the DN is of concern.  These two elements are left in the format of the URL to maintain the clarity of what information goes where in the string.</P>
<P>Suppose that the person in the example from above did in fact have an authentication username of &quot;adamson&quot; and that information was kept in the attribute &quot;uid&quot; in their LDAP entry. The <TT>sasl-regexp</TT> directive might be written as</P>
<PRE>
        sasl-regexp
          uid=(.*),cn=example.com,cn=kerberos_v4,cn=auth
          ldap:///ou=person,dc=example,dc=com??sub?(uid=$1)
</PRE>
<P>This will initiate an internal search of the LDAP database inside the slapd server. If the search returns exactly one entry, it is accepted as being the DN of the user. If there are more than one entries returned, or if there are zero entries returned, the authentication fails and the user's connection is left bound as the authentication request DN.</P>
<P>Note that if the search scope &lt;scope&gt; in the URL is &quot;base&quot;, then the only LDAP entry that will be returned is the searchbase DN &lt;base&gt;, so the actual search of the database is skipped. This is equivalent to setting the replacement pattern in the directive to a DN directly, as in the section above.</P>
<P>The attributes that are used in the search filter &lt;filter&gt; in the URL should be indexed to allow faster searching. If they are not, the authentication step alone can take uncomfortably long periods, and users may assume the server is down.</P>
<P>A more complex site might have several realms in use, each mapping to a different sub-tree in the directory. These can be handled with statements of the form:</P>
<PRE>
        # Match Engineering realm
       sasl-regexp
           uid=(.*),cn=engineering.example.com,cn=digest-md5,cn=auth
           ldap:///dc=eng,dc=example,dc=com??sub?(&amp;(uid=$1)(objectClass=person))

<H2><A NAME="SASL Proxy Authorization">10.3. SASL Proxy Authorization</A></H2>
<P>The SASL offers a feature known as <EM>proxy authorization</EM>, which allows an authenticated user to request that they act on the behalf of another user.  This step occurs after the user has obtained an authentication DN, and involves sending an authorization identity to the server. The server will then make a decision on whether or not to allow the authorization to occur. If it is allowed, the user's LDAP connection is switched to have a binding DN derived from the authorization identity, and the LDAP session proceeds with the access of the new authorization DN.</P>
<P>The decision to allow an authorization to proceed depends on the rules and policies of the site where LDAP is running, and thus cannot be made by SASL alone. The SASL library leaves it up to the server to make the decision. The LDAP administrator sets the guidelines of who can authorize to what identity by adding information into the LDAP database entries. By default, the authorization features are disabled, and must be explicitly configured by the LDAP administrator before use.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Uses of Proxy Authorization">10.3.1. Uses of Proxy Authorization</A></H3>
<P>This sort of service is useful when one entity needs to act on the behalf of many other users. For example, users may be directed to a web page to make changes to their personal information in their LDAP entry. The users authenticate to the web server to establish their identity, but the web server CGI cannot authenticate to the LDAP server as that user to make changes for them. Instead, the web server authenticates itself to the LDAP server as a service identity, say,</P>
<PRE>
        cn=WebUpdate,dc=example,dc=com
</PRE>
<P>and then it will SASL authorize to the DN of the user. Once so authorized, the CGI makes changes to the LDAP entry of the user, and as far as the slapd server can tell for its ACLs, it is the user themself on the other end of the connection. The user could have connected to the LDAP server directly and authenticated as themself, but that would require the user to have more knowledge of LDAP clients, knowledge which the web page provides in an easier format.</P>
<P>Proxy authorization can also be used to limit access to an account that has greater access to the database. Such an account, perhaps even the root DN specified in <EM>slapd.conf</EM>(5), can have a strict list of people who can authorize to that DN. Changes to the LDAP database could then be only allowed by that DN, and in order to become that DN, users must first authenticate as one of the persons on the list. This allows for better auditing of who made changes to the LDAP database.  If people were allowed to authenticate directly to the priviliged account, possibly through the <TT>rootpw</TT> <EM>slapd.conf</EM>(5) directive or through a <TT>userPassword</TT> attribute, then auditing becomes more difficult.</P>
<P>Note that after a successful proxy authorization, the original authentication DN of the LDAP connection is overwritten by the new DN from the authorization request. If a service program is able to authenticate itself as its own authentication DN and then authorize to other DN's, and it is planning on switching to several different identities during one LDAP session, it will need to authenticate itself each time before authorizing to another DN (or use a different proxy authorization mechanism).  The slapd server does not keep record of the service program's ability to switch to other DN's. On authentication mechanisms like Kerberos this will not require multiple connections being made to the Kerberos server, since the user's TGT and &quot;ldap&quot; session key are valid for multiple uses for the several hours of the ticket lifetime.</P>
<H3><A NAME="SASL Authorization Identities">10.3.2. SASL Authorization Identities</A></H3>
<P>The SASL authorization identity is sent to the LDAP server via the <TT>-X</TT> switch for <EM>ldapsearch</EM>(1) and other tools, or in the <TT>*authzid</TT> parameter to the <EM>lutil_sasl_defaults</EM>() call. The identity can be in one of two forms, either</P>
<PRE>
        u:&lt;username&gt;
</PRE>
<P>or</P>
<PRE>
        dn:&lt;dn&gt;
</PRE>
<P>In the first form, the &lt;username&gt; is from the same namespace as the authentication identities above. It is the user's username as it is refered to by the underlying authentication mechanism. Authorization identities of this form are converted into a DN format by the same function that the authentication process used, producing an <EM>authorization request DN</EM> of the form</P>
<PRE>
        uid=&lt;username&gt;,cn=&lt;realm&gt;,cn=&lt;mechanism&gt;,cn=auth
</PRE>
<P>That authorization request DN is then run through the same <TT>sasl-regexp</TT> process to convert it into a legitimate authorization DN from the database. If it cannot be converted due to a failed search from an LDAP URL, the authorization request fails with &quot;inappropriate access&quot;.  Otherwise, the DN string is now a legitimate authorization DN ready to undergo approval.</P>
<P>If the authorization identity was provided in the second form, with a <TT>&quot;dn:&quot;</TT> prefix, the string after the prefix is already in authorization DN form, ready to undergo approval.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Proxy Authorization Rules">10.3.3. Proxy Authorization Rules</A></H3>
<P>Once slapd has the authorization DN, the actual approval process begins. There are two attributes that the LDAP administrator can put into LDAP entries to allow authorization:</P>
<PRE>
        saslAuthzTo
        saslAuthzFrom
</PRE>
<P>Both can be multivalued.  The <TT>saslAuthzTo</TT> attribute is a source rule, and it is placed into the entry associated with the authentication DN to tell what authorization DNs the authenticated DN is allowed to assume.  The second attribute is a destination rule, and it is placed into the entry associated with the requested authorization DN to tell which authenticated DNs may assume it.</P>
<P>The choice of which authorization policy attribute to use is up to the administrator.  Source rules are checked first in the person's authentication DN entry, and if none of the <TT>saslAuthzTo</TT> rules specify the authorization is permitted, the <TT>saslAuthzFrom</TT> rules in the authorization DN entry are then checked. If neither case specifies that the request be honored, the request is denied. Since the default behaviour is to deny authorization requests, rules only specify that a request be allowed; there are no negative rules telling what authorizations to deny.</P>
<P>The value(s) in the two attributes are of the same form as the output of the replacement pattern of a <TT>sasl-regexp</TT> directive: either a DN or an LDAP URL. For example, if a <TT>saslAuthzTo</TT> value is a DN, that DN is one the authenticated user can authorize to. On the other hand, if the <TT>saslAuthzTo</TT> value is an LDAP URL, the URL is used as an internal search of the LDAP database, and the authenticated user can become ANY DN returned by the search. If an LDAP entry looked like:</P>
<PRE>
        dn: cn=WebUpdate,dc=example,dc=com
        saslAuthzTo: ldap:///dc=example,dc=com??sub?(objectclass=Person)
</PRE>
<P>then any user who authenticated as cn=WebUpdate,dc=example,dc=com could authorize to any other LDAP entry under the search base &quot;dc=example,dc=com&quot; which has an objectClass of &quot;Person&quot;.</P>
<H4><A NAME="Notes on Proxy Authorization Rules">10.3.3.1. Notes on Proxy Authorization Rules</A></H4>
<P>An LDAP URL in a <TT>saslAuthzTo</TT> or <TT>saslAuthzFrom</TT> attribute will return a set of DNs.  Each DN returned will be checked. Searches which return a large set can cause the authorization process to take an uncomfortably long time. Also, searches should be performed on attributes that have been indexed by slapd.</P>
<P>To help produce more sweeping rules for <TT>saslAuthzFrom</TT> and <TT>saslAuthzTo</TT>, the values of these attributes are allowed to be DNs with regular expression characters in them. This means a source rule like</P>
<PRE>
        saslAuthzTo: uid=.*,dc=example,dc=com
</PRE>
<P>would allow that authenticated user to authorize to any DN that matches the regular expression pattern given. This regular expression comparison can be evaluated much faster than an LDAP search for <TT>(uid=*)</TT>.</P>
<P>Also note that the values in an authorization rule must be one of the two forms: an LDAP URL or a DN (with or without regular expression characters). Anything that does not begin with &quot;<TT>ldap://</TT>&quot; is taken as a DN. It is not permissable to enter another authorization identity of the form &quot;<TT>u:&lt;username&gt;</TT>&quot; as an authorization rule.</P>
<H4><A NAME="Policy Configuration">10.3.3.2. Policy Configuration</A></H4>
<P>The decision of which type of rules to use, <TT>saslAuthzFrom</TT> or <TT>saslAuthzTo</TT>, will depend on the site's situation. For example, if the set of people who may become a given identity can easily be written as a search filter, then a single destination rule could be written. If the set of people is not easily defined by a search filter, and the set of people is small, it may be better to write a source rule in the entries of each of those people who should be allowed to perform the proxy authorization.</P>
<P>By default, processing of proxy authorization rules is disabled. The <TT>sasl-authz-policy</TT> directive must be set in the <EM>slapd.conf</EM>(5) file to enable authorization. This directive can be set to <TT>none</TT> for no rules (the default), <TT>from</TT> for source rules, <TT>to</TT> for destination rules, or <TT>both</TT> for both source and destination rules.</P>
<P>Destination rules are extremely powerful. If ordinary users have access to write the <TT>saslAuthzTo</TT> attribute in their own entries, then they can write rules that would allow them to authorize as anyone else. As such, when using destination rules, the <TT>saslAuthzTo</TT> attribute should be protected with an ACL that only allows privileged users to set its values.</P>

<H1><A NAME="Using TLS">11. Using TLS</A></H1>
<P>OpenLDAP clients and servers are capable of using the <TERM>Transport Layer Security</TERM> (<TERM>TLS</TERM>) framework to provide integrity and confidentiality protections and to support LDAP authentication using the <TERM>SASL</TERM> EXTERNAL mechanism.</P>
<H2><A NAME="TLS Certificates">11.1. TLS Certificates</A></H2>
<P>TLS uses <TERM>X.509</TERM> certificates to carry client and server identities. All servers are required to have valid certificates, whereas client certificates are optional. Clients must have a valid certificate in order to authenticate via SASL EXTERNAL. For more information on creating and managing certificates, see the <A HREF="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</A> documentation.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Server Certificates">11.1.1. Server Certificates</A></H3>
<P>The DN of a server certificate must use the CN attribute to name the server, and the <TT>CN</TT> must carry the server's fully qualified domain name. Additional alias names and wildcards may be present in the <TT>subjectAltName</TT> certificate extension. More details on server certificate names are in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2830.txt">RFC2830</A>.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Client Certificates">11.1.2. Client Certificates</A></H3>
<P>The DN of a client certificate can be used directly as an authentication DN. Since X.509 is a part of the <TERM>X.500</TERM> standard and LDAP is also based on X.500, both use the same DN formats and generally the DN in a user's X.509 certificate should be identical to the DN of their LDAP entry. However, sometimes the DNs may not be exactly the same, and so the mapping facility described in <A HREF="#Mapping Authentication identities to LDAP entries">Mapping Authentication identities to LDAP entries</A> can be applied to these DNs as well.</P>
<H2><A NAME="TLS Configuration">11.2. TLS Configuration</A></H2>
<P>After obtaining the required certificates, a number of options must be configured on both the client and the server to enable TLS and make use of the certificates. At a minimum, the clients must be configured with the filename containing all of the <TERM>Certificate Authority</TERM> (CA) certificates it will trust. The server must be configured with the <TERM>CA</TERM> certificates and also its own server certificate and private key.</P>
<P>Typically a single CA will have issued the server certificate and all of the trusted client certificates, so the server only needs to trust that one signing CA. However, a client may wish to connect to a variety of secure servers managed by different organizations, with server certificates generated by many different CAs. As such, a client is likely to need a list of many different trusted CAs in its configuration.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Server Configuration">11.2.1. Server Configuration</A></H3>
<P>The configuration directives for slapd belong in the global directives section of <EM>slapd.conf</EM>(5).</P>
<H4><A NAME="TLSCACertificateFile &lt;filename&gt;">11.2.1.1. TLSCACertificateFile &lt;filename&gt;</A></H4>
<P>This directive specifies the <TERM>PEM</TERM>-format file containing certificates for the CA's that slapd will trust. The certificate for the CA that signed the server certificate must be included among these certificates. If the signing CA was not a top-level (root) CA, certificates for the entire sequence of CA's from the signing CA to the top-level CA should be present. Multiple certificates are simply appended to the file; the order is not significant.</P>
<H4><A NAME="TLSCACertificatePath &lt;path&gt;">11.2.1.2. TLSCACertificatePath &lt;path&gt;</A></H4>
<P>This directive specifies the path of a directory that contains individual <TERM>CA</TERM> certificates in separate files.  In addition, this directory must be specially managed using the OpenSSL <EM>c_rehash</EM> utility. When using this feature, the OpenSSL library will attempt to locate certificate files based on a hash of their name and serial number. The <EM>c_rehash</EM> utility is used to generate symbolic links with the hashed names that point to the actual certificate files. As such, this option can only be used with a filesystem that actually supports symbolic links. In general, it is simpler to use the <TT>TLSCACertificateFile</TT> directive instead.</P>
<H4><A NAME="TLSCertificateFile &lt;filename&gt;">11.2.1.3. TLSCertificateFile &lt;filename&gt;</A></H4>
<P>This directive specifies the file that contains the slapd server certificate. Certificates are generally public information and require no special protection.</P>
<H4><A NAME="TLSCertificateKeyFile &lt;filename&gt;">11.2.1.4. TLSCertificateKeyFile &lt;filename&gt;</A></H4>
<P>This directive specifies the file that contains the private key that matches the certificate stored in the <TT>TLSCertificateFile</TT> file. Private keys themselves are sensitive data and are usually password encrypted for protection. However, the current implementation doesn't support encrypted keys so the key must not be encrypted and the file itself must be protected carefully.</P>
<H4><A NAME="TLSCipherSuite &lt;cipher-suite-spec&gt;">11.2.1.5. TLSCipherSuite &lt;cipher-suite-spec&gt;</A></H4>
<P>This directive configures what ciphers will be accepted and the preference order. <TT>&lt;cipher-suite-spec&gt;</TT> should be a cipher specification for OpenSSL. You can use the command</P>
<PRE>
        openssl ciphers -v ALL
</PRE>
<P>to obtain a verbose list of available cipher specifications. Besides the individual cipher names, the specifiers <TT>HIGH</TT>, <TT>MEDIUM</TT>, <TT>LOW</TT>, <TT>EXPORT</TT>, and <TT>EXPORT40</TT> may be helpful, along with <TT>TLSv1</TT>, <TT>SSLv3</TT>, and <TT>SSLv2</TT>.</P>
<H4><A NAME="TLSRandFile &lt;filename&gt;">11.2.1.6. TLSRandFile &lt;filename&gt;</A></H4>
<P>This directive specifies the file to obtain random bits from when <TT>/dev/urandom</TT> is not available. If the system provides <TT>/dev/urandom</TT> then this option is not needed, otherwise a source of random data must be configured. Some systems (e.g. Linux) provide <TT>/dev/urandom</TT> by default, while others (e.g. Solaris) require the installation of a patch to provide it, and others may not support it at all. In the latter case, EGD or PRNGD should be installed, and this directive should specify the name of the EGD/PRNGD socket. The environment variable <TT>RANDFILE</TT> can also be used to specify the filename. Also, in the absence of these options, the <TT>.rnd</TT> file in the slapd user's home directory may be used if it exists. To use the <TT>.rnd</TT> file, just create the file and copy a few hundred bytes of arbitrary data into the file. The file is only used to provide a seed for the pseudo-random number generator, and it doesn't need very much data to work.</P>
<H4><A NAME="TLSVerifyClient { never | allow | try | demand }">11.2.1.7. TLSVerifyClient { never | allow | try | demand }</A></H4>
<P>This directive specifies what checks to perform on client certificates in an incoming TLS session, if any. This option is set to <TT>never</TT> by default, in which case the server never asks the client for a certificate. With a setting of <TT>allow</TT> the server will ask for a client certificate; if none is provided the session proceeds normally. If a certificate is provided but the server is unable to verify it, the certificate is ignored and the session proceeds normally, as if no certificate had been provided. With a setting of <TT>try</TT> the certificate is requested, and if none is provided, the session proceeds normally. If a certificate is provided and it cannot be verified, the session is immediately terminated. With a setting of <TT>demand</TT> the certificate is requested and a valid certificate must be provided, otherwise the session is immediately terminated.</P>
<P><HR WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="Left">
<STRONG>Note: </STRONG>The server must request a client certificate in order to use the SASL EXTERNAL authentication mechanism with a TLS session. As such, a non-default <TT>TLSVerifyClient</TT> setting must be configured before SASL EXTERNAL authentication may be attempted, and the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism will only be offered to the client if a valid client certificate was received.
<HR WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="Left"></P>
<H3><A NAME="Client Configuration">11.2.2. Client Configuration</A></H3>
<P>Most of the client configuration directives parallel the server directives. The names of the directives are different, and they go into <EM>ldap.conf</EM>(5) instead of <EM>slapd.conf</EM>(5), but their functionality is mostly the same. Also, while most of these options may be configured on a system-wide basis, they may all be overridden by individual users in their <EM>.ldaprc</EM> files.</P>
<H4><A NAME="TLS_CACERT &lt;filename&gt;">11.2.2.1. TLS_CACERT &lt;filename&gt;</A></H4>
<P>This is equivalent to the server's <TT>TLSCACertificateFile</TT> option. As noted in the <A HREF="#TLS Configuration">TLS Configuration</A> section, a client typically may need to know about more CAs than a server, but otherwise the same considerations apply.</P>
<H4><A NAME="TLS_CACERTDIR &lt;path&gt;">11.2.2.2. TLS_CACERTDIR &lt;path&gt;</A></H4>
<P>This is equivalent to the server's <TT>TLSCACertificatePath</TT> option. The specified directory must be managed with the OpenSSL <EM>c_rehash</EM> utility as well.</P>
<H4><A NAME="TLS_CERT &lt;filename&gt;">11.2.2.3. TLS_CERT &lt;filename&gt;</A></H4>
<P>This directive specifies the file that contains the client certificate. This is a user-only directive and can only be specified in a user's <EM>.ldaprc</EM> file.</P>
<H4><A NAME="TLS_KEY &lt;filename&gt;">11.2.2.4. TLS_KEY &lt;filename&gt;</A></H4>
<P>This directive specifies the file that contains the private key that matches the certificate stored in the <TT>TLS_CERT</TT> file. The same constraints mentioned for <TT>TLSCertificateKeyFile</TT> apply here. This is also a user-only directive.</P>
<H4><A NAME="TLS_RANDFILE &lt;filename&gt;">11.2.2.5. TLS_RANDFILE &lt;filename&gt;</A></H4>
<P>This directive is the same as the server's <TT>TLSRandFile</TT> option.</P>
<H4><A NAME="TLS_REQCERT { never | allow | try | demand }">11.2.2.6. TLS_REQCERT { never | allow | try | demand }</A></H4>
<P>This directive is equivalent to the server's <TT>TLSVerifyClient</TT> option. However, for clients the default value is <TT>demand</TT> and there generally is no good reason to change this setting.</P>
<H4><A NAME="TLS { never | hard }">11.2.2.7. TLS { never | hard }</A></H4>
<P>This directive specifies whether client connections should use TLS by default. The default setting is <TT>never</TT> which specifies that connections will be opened in the clear unless TLS is explicitly specified using an &quot;ldaps://&quot; URL. When set to <TT>hard</TT> all connections will be established with TLS, as if an &quot;ldaps://&quot; URL was specified. Note that the use of ldaps is a holdover from LDAPv2 and this setting is incompatible with the LDAPv3 StartTLS request. As such, it's best not to use this option.</P>

<H1><A NAME="Constructing a Distributed Directory Service">12. Constructing a Distributed Directory Service</A></H1>
<P>For many sites, running one or more <EM>slapd</EM>(8) that hold an entire subtree of data is sufficient. But often it is desirable to have one <EM>slapd</EM> refer to other directory services for a certain part of the tree (which may or may not be running <EM>slapd</EM>).</P>
<P><EM>slapd</EM> supports <EM>subordinate</EM> and <EM>superior</EM> knowledge information. Subordinate knowledge information is held in <TT>referral</TT> objects (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc3296.txt">RFC3296</A>).</P>
<H2><A NAME="Subordinate Knowledge Information">12.1. Subordinate Knowledge Information</A></H2>
<P>Subordinate knowledge information may be provided to delegate a subtree. Subordinate knowledge information is maintained in the directory as a special <EM>referral</EM> object at the delegate point. The referral object acts as a delegation point, gluing two services together. This mechanism allows for hierarchical directory services to be constructed.</P>
<P>A referral object has a structural object class of <TT>referral</TT> and has the same <TERM>Distinguished Name</TERM> as the delegated subtree.  Generally, the referral object will also provide the auxiliary object class <TT>extensibleObject</TT>. This allows the entry to contain appropriate <TERM>Relative Distinguished Name</TERM> values.  This is best demonstrated by example.</P>
<P>If the server <TT>a.example.net</TT> holds <TT>dc=example,dc=net</TT> and wished to delegate the subtree <TT>ou=subtree,dc=example,dc=net</TT> to another server <TT>b.example.net</TT>, the following named referral object would be added to <TT>a.example.net</TT>:</P>

</PRE>
<P>The server uses this information to generate referrals and search continuations to subordinate servers.</P>
<P>For those familiar with X.500, a <EM>named referral</EM> object is similar to an X.500 knowledge reference held in a <EM>subr</EM> <TERM>DSE</TERM>.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Superior Knowledge Information">12.2. Superior Knowledge Information</A></H2>
<P>Superior knowledge information may be specified using the <TT>referral</TT> directive.  The value is a list of <TERM>URI</TERM>s referring to superior directory services.  For servers without immediate superiors, such as for <TT>a.example.net</TT> in the example above, the server can be configured to use a directory service with <EM>global knowledge</EM>, such as the <EM>OpenLDAP Root Service</EM> (<A HREF="http://www.openldap.org/faq/index.cgi?file=393">http://www.openldap.org/faq/index.cgi?file=393</A>).</P>

<P>However, as <TT>a.example.net</TT> is the <EM>immediate superior</EM> to <TT>b.example.net</TT>, <EM>b.example.net</EM> would be configured as follows:</P>
<PRE>
        referral        ldap://a.example.net/

<P>The server uses this information to generate referrals for operations acting upon entries not within or subordinate to any of the naming contexts held by the server.</P>
<P>For those familiar with X.500, this use of the <TT>ref</TT> attribute is similar to an X.500 knowledge reference held in a <EM>Supr</EM> <TERM>DSE</TERM>.</P>
<H2><A NAME="The ManageDsaIT Control">12.3. The ManageDsaIT Control</A></H2>
<P>Adding, modifying, and deleting referral objects is generally done using <EM>ldapmodify</EM>(1) or similar tools which support the ManageDsaIT control.

<H1><A NAME="Replication with slurpd">13. Replication with slurpd</A></H1>
<P>In certain configurations, a single <EM>slapd</EM>(8) instance may be insufficient to handle the number of clients requiring directory service via LDAP. It may become necessary to run more than one slapd instance.  At many sites, for instance, there are multiple slapd servers: one master and one or more slaves.  <TERM>DNS</TERM> can be setup such that a lookup of <TT>ldap.example.com</TT> returns the <TERM>IP</TERM> addresses of these servers, distributing the load among them (or just the slaves). This master/slave arrangement provides a simple and effective way to increase capacity, availability and reliability.</P>
<P><EM>slurpd</EM>(8) provides the capability for a master slapd to propagate changes to slave slapd instances, implementing the master/slave replication scheme described above.  slurpd runs on the same host as the master slapd instance.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Overview">13.1. Overview</A></H2>
<P><EM>slurpd</EM>(8) provides replication services &quot;in band&quot;. That is, it uses the LDAP protocol to update a slave database from the master.

In this example, we trace the propagation of an LDAP modify operation from its initiation by the LDAP client to its distribution to the slave slapd instance.</P>
<P><B>Sample replication scenario:</B></P>

<LI>The master slapd performs the modify operation, writes out the change to its replication log file and returns a success code to the client.
<LI>The slurpd process notices that a new entry has been appended to the replication log file, reads the replication log entry, and sends the change to the slave slapd via LDAP.

<H1><A NAME="Generic configure Instructions">A. Generic configure Instructions</A></H1>
<PRE>
Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
this:
     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
architecture.

Installation Names
==================

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Optional Features
=================

   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognizes.

   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

   There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
`--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the host type.

   If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
produce code for and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of
system on which you are compiling the package.

Sharing Defaults
================

   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Operation Controls
==================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
     debugging `configure'.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--version'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.
