These files are here specifically for use in building the nss_ldap package,
and should not be used for any other purpose.

They contain a backported patch which adds two functions which nss_ldap can
use to avoid blocking in one particular use case, but which are not included
in the 2.2 branch of OpenLDAP.

When the openldap package updates to 2.3, these libraries will simply
disappear.
